However, the implications of scATAC-seq data binarization have never been assessed. Here, we show that the goodness-of-fit of existing models and their applications including clustering, cell type identification, and batch integration, are improved by a quantitative treatment of the fragment counts. These results have immediate implications for scATAC-seq analysis.	anndata, eml, scanpy, scvi-tools, wandb	peakVI	Modeling fragment counts improves single-cell ATAC-seq analysis	10.10351795	7.351020194	4.992189688	10.1101/2022.05.04.490536	2	Martens LD, Fischer DS, Theis FJ, Gagneur J.

However, the characteristics of scCAS data, including high dimensionality, high degree of sparsity and high technical variation, make the computational analysis challenging. Reference-guided approaches, which utilize the information in existing datasets, may facilitate the analysis of scCAS data. Here, we present RA3 (Reference-guided Approach for the Analysis of single-cell chromatin Accessibility data), which utilizes the information in massive existing bulk chromatin accessibility and annotated scCAS data. RA3 simultaneously models (1) the shared biological variation among scCAS data and the reference data, and (2) the unique biological variation in scCAS data that identifies distinct subpopulations. We show that RA3 achieves superior performance when used on several scCAS datasets, and on references constructed using various approaches. Altogether, these analyses demonstrate the wide applicability of RA3 in analyzing scCAS data.	devtools, Seurat	SCALE, Scasat, cisTopic, Cusanovich2018, snapATAC	RA3 is a reference-guided approach for epigenetic characterization of single cells	10.895618	9.664850094	8.572414644	10.1101/2020.06.16.155010	6	Chen S, Yan G, Zhang W, Li J, Jiang R, Lin Z.

We present CellSpace, an efficient and scalable sequence-informed embedding algorithm for scATAC-seq that learns a mapping of DNA k-mers and cells to the same space. CellSpace captures meaningful latent structure in scATAC-seq datasets, including cell subpopulations and developmental hierarchies, and scores the activity of transcription factors in single cells based on proximity to binding motifs embedded in the same space. Importantly, CellSpace implicitly mitigates batch effects arising from multiple samples, donors, or assays, even when individual datasets are processed relative to different peak atlases. Thus, CellSpace provides a powerful tool for integrating and interpreting large-scale scATAC-seq compendia.	biostrings, devtools, Seurat	ArchR, scBasset	Scalable sequence-informed embedding of single-cell ATAC-seq data with CellSpace	40.45376474	21.03210006	9.713702569	10.1101/2022.05.02.490310	5	Tayyebi Z, Pine AR, Leslie CS.

We recently developed scGET-seq, a technique that exploits a Hybrid Transposase (tnH) along with the canonical enzyme (tn5), which is able to profile altogether closed and open chromatin in a single experiment. This technique adds an important feature to the classic scATAC-seq assays. In fact, the lack of a closed chromatin signal in scATAC: (i) restricts sampling of DNA sequence to a very small portion of the chromosomal landscapes, substantially reducing the ability to investigate copy number alteration and sequence variations, and (ii) hampers the opportunity to identify regions of closed chromatin, that cannot be distinguished between non-sampled open regions and truly closed. scGET-seq overcomes these issues in the context of single cells. In this work, we describe the latest advances in the statistical analysis and modeling of scGET-seq data, touching several aspects of the computational framework: from dimensionality reduction, to statistical modeling, and trajectory analysis.

However, how to use those datasets to dissect the cis-regulatory element (CRE)–to–gene relationships at a single-cell level remains a major challenge. Here, we present DIRECT-NET, a machine-learning method based on gradient boosting, to identify genome-wide CREs and their relationship to target genes, either from parallel single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility data or from single-cell chromatin accessibility data alone. By extensively evaluating and characterizing DIRECT-NET’s predicted CREs using independent functional genomics data, we find that DIRECT-NET substantially improves the accuracy of inferring CRE-to-gene relationships in comparison to existing methods. DIRECT-NET is also capable of revealing cell subpopulation–specific and dynamic regulatory linkages. Overall, DIRECT-NET provides an efficient tool for predicting transcriptional regulation codes from single-cell multiomics data.	devtools, Seurat	CloseGene, Distance, Cicero, ArchR, Spearman correlation, LASSO regression, Ridge, snapATAC	DIRECT-NET: An efficient method to discover cis-regulatory elements and construct regulatory networks from single-cell multiomics data	36.24160495	19.12699879	12.50203289	None	4	Zhang, L., Zhang, J., & Nie, Q..

scEpiLock	Python	0	differential feature analysis	differential feature analysis	A weakly supervised deep learning method, scEpiLock, to precisely locate CREs and quantify variant impacts in a cell-type-specific manner with three modules: (i) multi-label classifier module, (ii) object detection module, (iii) variant impact quantification module.	10.3390/biom12070874	Biomolecules	Published	https://github.com/aicb-ZhangLabs/scEpiLock	2022.11.08	2022.11.08	2021.12.14	convolutional neural network	CAS	2022.05.06	None	0		2	1	Recent advances in single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin using a sequencing assay (scATAC-seq) allow cellular heterogeneity dissection and regulatory landscape reconstruction with an unprecedented resolution. However, compared to bulk-sequencing, its ultra-high missingness remarkably reduces usable reads in each cell type, resulting in broader, fuzzier peak boundary definitions and limiting our ability to pinpoint functional regions and interpret variant impacts precisely. We propose a weakly supervised learning method, scEpiLock, to directly identify core functional regions from coarse peak labels and quantify variant impacts in a cell-type-specific manner. First, scEpiLock uses a multi-label classifier to predict chromatin accessibility via a deep convolutional neural network. Then, its weakly supervised object detection module further refines the peak boundary definition using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). Finally, scEpiLock provides cell-type-specific variant impacts within a given peak region. We applied scEpiLock to various scATAC-seq datasets and found that it achieves an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of ~0.9 and an area under precision recall (AUPR) above 0.7. Besides, scEpiLock’s object detection condenses coarse peaks to only ⅓ of their original size while still reporting higher conservation scores. In addition, we applied scEpiLock on brain scATAC-seq data and reported several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) variants disrupting regulatory elements around known risk genes for Alzheimer’s disease, demonstrating its potential to provide cell-type-specific biological insights in disease studies.	torch	DeepSEA, DanQ, RF	scEpiLock: A Weakly Supervised Learning Framework for cis-Regulatory Element Localization and Variant Impact Quantification for Single-Cell Epigenetic Data	6.25143735	5.409130033	6.068373538	None	3	Gong Y, Srinivasan SS, Zhang R, Kessenbrock K, Zhang J. scEpiLock: A Weakly Supervised Learning Framework for cis-Regulatory Element Localization and Variant Impact Quantification for Single-Cell Epigenetic Data.

Here we propose SCRaPL, a novel computational tool that increases power by carefully modelling noise in the experimental systems. We show on real and simulated multi-omics single-cell data sets that SCRaPL achieves higher sensitivity and better robustness in identifying correlations, while maintain- ing a similar level of false positives as standard analyses based on Pearson and Spearman correlation. 	tensorflow	Classical Pearson, Spearman	SCRaPL: A Bayesian hierarchical framework for detecting technical associates in single cell multiomics data	6.424040767	6.206376555	5.998909702	None	4	Maniatis C, Vallejos CA, Sanguinetti G.

Existing methods tend to use a pre-defined gene activity matrix to convert the scATAC-seq data into scRNA-seq data. The pre-defined gene activity matrix is often of low quality and does not reflect the dataset-specific relationship between the two data modalities. We propose scDART, a deep learning framework that integrates scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data and learns cross-modalities relationships simultaneously. Specifically, the design of scDART allows it to preserve cell trajectories in continuous cell populations and can be applied to trajectory inference on integrated data.	torch	Liger, Seurat, UnionCom	scDART: integrating unmatched scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data and learning cross-modality relationship simultaneously	35.68113072	18.85708485	9.700272543	None	4	Zhang Z, Yang C, Zhang X. scDART: integrating unmatched scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data and learning cross-modality relationship simultaneously.

Such challenges in data generation emphasize the need for informative features to assess cell heterogeneity at the chromatin level. Results: We present a benchmarking framework that is applied to 10 computational methods for scATAC-seq on 13 synthetic and real datasets from different assays, profiling cell types from diverse tissues and organisms. Methods for processing and featurizing scATAC-seq data were compared by their ability to discriminate cell types when combined with common unsupervised clustering approaches. We rank evaluated methods and discuss computational challenges associated with scATAC-seq analysis including inherently sparse data, determination of features, peak calling, the effects of sequencing coverage and noise, and clustering performance. Running times and memory requirements are also discussed. Conclusions: This reference summary of scATAC-seq methods offers recommendations for best practices with consideration for both the non-expert user and the methods developer. Despite variation across methods and datasets, SnapATAC, Cusanovich2018, and cisTopic outperform other methods in separating cell populations of different coverages and noise levels in both synthetic and real datasets. Notably, SnapATAC is the only method able to analyze a large dataset (> 80,000 cells).

These regions usually correspond to active regulatory elements and their location profile is unique to a given cell type. When done at single-cell resolution, ATAC-seq provides an insight into the cell-to-cell variability that emerges from otherwise identical DNA sequences by identifying the variability in the genomic location of open chromatin sites in each of the cells. This paper presents Scasat (single-cell ATAC-seq analysis tool), a complete pipeline to process scATAC-seq data with simple steps. Scasat treats the data as binary and applies statistical methods that are especially suitable for binary data. The pipeline is developed in a Jupyter notebook environment that holds the executable code along with the necessary description and results. It is robust, flexible, interactive and easy to extend. Within Scasat we developed a novel differential accessibility analysis method based on information gain to identify the peaks that are unique to a cell. The results from Scasat showed that open chromatin locations corresponding to potential regulatory elements can account for cellular heterogeneity and can identify regulatory regions that separates cells from a complex population.	bedtools, bowtie2, MACS2, picard, samtools, trimmomatic	None	Classifying cells with Scasat, a single-cell ATAC-seq analysis tool	64.03203545	34.43002446	9.283168241	None	2	Baker SM, Rogerson C, Hayes A, Sharrocks AD, Rattray M.

Conventional assays to map regulatory elements via open chromatin analysis of primary tissues is hindered by sample heterogeneity. Single cell analysis of accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) can over- come this limitation. However, the high-level noise of each single cell profile and the large volume of data pose unique computational challenges. Here, we introduce SnapATAC, a software package for analyzing scATAC-seq datasets. SnapATAC dissects cellular hetero- geneity in an unbiased manner and map the trajectories of cellular states. Using the Nyström method, SnapATAC can process data from up to a million cells. Furthermore, SnapATAC incorporates existing tools into a comprehensive package for analyzing single cell ATAC-seq dataset. As demonstration of its utility, SnapATAC is applied to 55,592 single-nucleus ATAC- seq profiles from the mouse secondary motor cortex. The analysis reveals ~370,000 can- didate regulatory elements in 31 distinct cell populations in this brain region and inferred candidate cell-type specific transcriptional regulators.

However, the high dimen- sionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data often complicate the analysis. Here, we introduce a method for analyzing scATAC-seq data, called Single-Cell ATAC-seq analysis via Latent feature Extraction (SCALE). SCALE combines a deep generative framework and a probabil- istic Gaussian Mixture Model to learn latent features that accurately characterize scATAC- seq data. We validate SCALE on datasets generated on different platforms with different protocols, and having different overall data qualities. SCALE substantially outperforms the other tools in all aspects of scATAC-seq data analysis, including visualization, clustering, and denoising and imputation. Importantly, SCALE also generates interpretable features that directly link to cell populations, and can potentially reveal batch effects in scATAC-seq experiments. 	torch	PCA, scVI, cisTopic, scABC, SC3, MAGIC, SAVER, scImpute	SCALE method for single-cell ATAC-seq analysis via latent feature extraction	116.6951288	66.78495543	20.88340041	None	6	Xiong L, Xu K, Tian K, Shao Y, Tang L, Gao G, Zhang M, Jiang T, Zhang QC.

The data from scATAC-seq are unique—sparse, binary and highly variable even within the same cell type. As such, neither methods developed for bulk ATAC-seq nor single-cell RNA-seq data are appropriate. Here, we present Destin, a bioinformatic and statistical framework for comprehensive scATAC-seq data analysis. Destin performs cell-type clustering via weighted principle component analysis, weighting accessible chromatin regions by existing genomic annotations and publicly available regulomic datasets. The weights and additional tuning parameters are determined via model-based likelihood. We evaluated the performance of Destin using downsampled bulk ATAC-seq data of purified samples and scATAC-seq data from seven diverse experiments. Compared to existing methods, Destin was shown to outperform across all datasets and platforms. For demonstration, we further applied Destin to 2088 adult mouse forebrain cells and identified cell-type-specific association of previously reported schizophrenia GWAS loci.

Single-cell ATAC-seq data are sparse and noisy, and analyzing such data is challenging. Existing computational methods cannot accurately reconstruct activities of individual cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in individual cells or rare cell subpopulations. We present a new statistical framework, SCATE, that adaptively integrates information from co-activated CREs, similar cells, and publicly available regulome data to substantially increase the accuracy for estimating activities of individual CREs. We demonstrate that SCATE can be used to better reconstruct the regulatory landscape of a heterogeneous sample.

The revolution in high-throughput methods has accumulated massive chromatin accessibility profiles in public repositories. Nevertheless, utilization of these data is hampered by cumbersome collection, time-consuming processing, and manual chromatin accessibility (openness) annotation of genomic regions. To fill this gap, we developed OpenAnnotate (http://health.tsinghua.edu.cn/openannotate/) as the first web server for efficiently annotating openness of massive genomic regions across various biosample types, tissues, and biological systems. In addition to the annotation resource from 2729 comprehensive profiles of 614 biosample types of human and mouse, OpenAnnotate provides user-friendly functionalities, ultra-efficient calculation, real-time browsing, intuitive visualization, and elaborate application notebooks. We show its unique advantages compared to existing databases and toolkits by effectively revealing cell type-specificity, identifying regulatory elements and 3D chromatin contacts, deciphering gene functional relationships, inferring functions of transcription factors, and unprecedentedly promoting single-cell data analyses. We anticipate OpenAnnotate will provide a promising avenue for researchers to construct a more holistic perspective to understand regulatory mechanisms.

However, the characteristics of scATAC-seq data, including high sparsity and high dimensionality, have greatly complicated the computational analysis. Here, we propose scDEC, a computa- tional tool for scATAC-seq analysis with deep generative neural networks. scDEC is built on a pair of generative adversarial net- works, and is capable of simultaneously learning the latent representation and inferring cell labels. In a series of experiments, scDEC demonstrates superior performance over other tools in scATAC-seq analysis across multiple datasets and experimental settings. In downstream applications, we demonstrate that the generative power of scDEC helps to infer the trajectory and intermediate state of cells during differentiation and the latent features learned by scDEC can potentially reveal both biologi- cal cell types and within-cell-type variations. We also show that it is possible to extend scDEC for the integrative analysis of multi-modal single cell data. 	tensorflow	cisTopic, Cusanovich2018, Scasat, snapATAC, scDEC	Simultaneous deep generative modelling and clustering of single-cell genomic data	42.41810782	26.52295241	11.93559057	None	6	Liu Q, Chen S, Jiang R, Wong WH.

Computational methods for automatic cell type annotation are urgently needed given the exponential growth in the number of cells. In particular, annotation of single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scCAS) data, which can capture the chromatin regulatory landscape that governs transcription in each cell type, has not been fully investigated. Here we propose EpiAnno, a probabilistic generative model integrated with a Bayesian neural network, to annotate scCAS data automatically in a super- vised manner. We systematically validate the superior performance of EpiAnno for both intra- and inter-dataset annotation on various datasets. We further demonstrate the advantages of EpiAnno for interpretable embedding and biological implications via expression enrichment analysis, partitioned heritability analysis, enhancer identification, cis-coaccessibility analysis and pathway enrichment analysis. In addition, we show that EpiAnno has the potential to reveal cell type-specific motifs and facili- tate scCAS data simulation. 	torch, tensorflow	GNB, RF, SVM, jNN, ACTINN, SuperCT, MLP	Cell type annotation of single-cell chromatin accessibility data via supervised Bayesian embedding	48.82314989	30.92074024	15.98970404	None	12	Chen X, Chen S, Song S, Gao Z, Hou L, Zhang X, Lv H, Jiang R.

Here, we introduce Cicero, an algorithm that identifies co-accessible pairs of DNA elements using single-cell chromatin accessibility data and so connects regulatory elements to their putative target genes. We apply Cicero to investigate how dynamically accessible elements orchestrate gene regulation in differentiating myoblasts. Groups of Cicero-linked regulatory elements meet criteria of ‘‘chromatin hubs’’—they are enriched for physical proximity, interact with a common set of transcription factors, and undergo coordinated changes in histone marks that are predictive of changes in gene expression. Pseudotemporal analysis revealed that most DNA elements remain in chromatin hubs throughout differentiation. A subset of elements bound by MYOD1 in myoblasts exhibit early opening in a PBX1- and MEIS1-dependent manner. Our strategy can be applied to dissect the architecture, sequence determinants, and mechanisms of cis-regulation on a genome-wide scale.

However, the methods and software were designed for one certain data type and only for single cell transcriptome data. A systematic approach for epigenome data and multiple types of transcriptome data is needed to control data quality and to perform cell-to-cell heterogeneity analysis on these ultra-high-dimensional transcriptome and epigenome datasets. Here we developed Dr. seq2, a Quality Control (QC) and analysis pipeline for multiple types of single cell transcriptome and epigenome data, including scATAC-seq and Drop-ChIP data. Application of this pipeline provides four groups of QC measurements and different analyses, including cell heterogeneity analysis.

Here, we introduce ‘‘weighted-nearest neighbor’’ analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of 211,000 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with panels extending to 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Currently, most single-cell analysis pipelines are cluster-centric and 20 cannot explicitly model the interactions between different feature types. In addition, single-cell 21 methods are generally designed for a particular task as distinct single-cell problems are 22 formulated differently. To address these current shortcomings, we present SIMBA, a graph 23 embedding method that jointly embeds single cells and their defining features, such as genes, 24 chromatin accessible regions, and transcription factor binding sequences into a common latent 25 space. By leveraging the co-embedding of cells and features, SIMBA allows for the study of 26 cellular heterogeneity, clustering-free marker discovery, gene regulation inference, batch effect 27 removal, and omics data integration. SIMBA has been extensively applied to scRNA-seq, 28 scATAC-seq, and dual-omics data. We show that SIMBA provides a single framework that allows 29 diverse single-cell analysis problems to be formulated in a unified way and thus simplifies the 30 development of new analyses and integration of other single-cell modalities. SIMBA is 31 implemented as an efficient, comprehensive, and extensible Python library (https://simba32 bio.readthedocs.io) for the analysis of single-cell omics data using graph embedding.	adjusttext, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, pybedtools, scikit-learn, scikit-misc, scipy, seaborn, tables, umap-learn	snapATAC, Cusanovich2018, cisTopic	SIMBA: SIngle-cell eMBedding Along with features	65.08848093	41.80284181	16.44520352	10.1101/2021.10.17.464750	15	Chen H, Ryu J, Vinyard ME, Lerer A, Pinello L.

We show that scOpen improves crucial downstream analysis steps of scATAC-seq data as clustering, visualization, cis-regulatory DNA interac- tions, and delineation of regulatory features. We demonstrate the power of scOpen to dissect regulatory changes in the development of fibrosis in the kidney.

However, the high noise levels, degree of sparsity, and scale of the generated data make its analysis challenging. Here, we present PeakVI, a probabilistic framework that leverages deep neural networks to analyze scATAC-seq data. PeakVI fits an informative latent space that preserves biological heterogeneity while correcting batch effects and accounting for technical effects, such as library size and region-specific biases. In addition, PeakVI provides a technique for identifying differential accessibility at a single-region resolution, which can be used for cell-type annotation as well as identification of key cis-regulatory elements. We use public datasets to demonstrate that PeakVI is scalable, stable, robust to low-quality data, and outperforms current analysis methods on a range of critical analysis tasks.

Thus, joint analysis of atlas datasets requires reliable data integration. To guide integration method choice, we benchmarked 68 method and preprocessing combinations on 85 batches of gene expression, chromatin accessibility and simu- lation data from 23 publications, altogether representing >1.2 million cells distributed in 13 atlas-level integration tasks. We evaluated methods according to scalability, usability and their ability to remove batch effects while retaining biological variation using 14 evaluation metrics. We show that highly variable gene selection improves the performance of data integration meth- ods, whereas scaling pushes methods to prioritize batch removal over conservation of biological variation. Overall, scANVI, Scanorama, scVI and scGen perform well, particularly on complex integration tasks, while single-cell ATAC-sequencing integra- tion performance is strongly affected by choice of feature space.

While there have beenimpressive technical innovations demonstrating feasibility—forexample, generating paired measurements of single-cell transcrip-tome (single-cell RNA sequencing [scRNA-seq]) and chromatin ac-cessibility (single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatinusing sequencing [scATAC-seq])—widespread application of jointprofiling is challenging due to its experimental complexity, noise,and cost. Here, we introduce BABEL, a deep learning method thattranslates between the transcriptome and chromatin profiles of asingle cell. Leveraging an interoperable neural network model,BABEL can predict single-cell expression directly from a cell’sscATAC-seq and vice versa after training on relevant data. Thismakes it possible to computationally synthesize paired multiomicmeasurements when only one modality is experimentally avail-able. Across several paired single-cell ATAC and gene expressiondatasets in human and mouse, we validate that BABEL accuratelytranslates between these modalities for individual cells. BABELalso generalizes well to cell types within new biological contextsnot seen during training.

As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a strategy to ‘‘anchor’’ diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate single-cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but also across different modalities. After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNAseq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns.

However, it remains challenging to characterize their regulatory heterogeneity due to the high-dimensional, sparse and near-binary nature of data. Most existing data representation methods were designed based on correlation, which may be ill-defined for sparse data. Moreover, these methods do not well address the issue of excessive zeros. Thus, a simple, fast and scalable approach is needed to analyze single-cell ATAC-seq data with massive cells, address the “missingness” and accurately categorize cell types. To this end, we developed a network diffusion method for scalable embedding of massive single-cell ATAC-seq data (named as scAND). Specifically, we considered the near-binary single-cell ATAC-seq data as a bipartite network that reflects the accessible relationship between cells and accessible regions, and further adopted a simple and scalable network diffusion method to embed it. scAND can take information from similar cells to alleviate the sparsity and improve cell type identification. Extensive tests and comparison with existing methods using synthetic and real data as benchmarks demonstrated its distinct superiorities in terms of clustering accuracy, robustness, scalability and data integration.

However, existing methods for cis-regulatory network reconstruction using single-cell chromatin accessibility data were only designed for cells belonging to one cell type, and resulting networks may be incomparable directly due to diverse cell numbers of different cell types. Here, we adopt a computational method to jointly reconstruct cis-regulatory interaction maps (JRIM) of multiple cell populations based on patterns of co-accessibility in single-cell data. We applied JRIM to explore common and specific regulatory interactions across multiple tissues from single-cell ATAC-seq dataset containing ∼80 000 cells across 13 mouse tissues. Reconstructed common interactions among 13 tissues indeed relate to basic biological functions, and individual cis-regulatory networks show strong tissue specificity and functional relevance. More importantly, tissue-specific regulatory interactions are mediated by coordination of histone modifications and tissue-related TFs, and many of them may reveal novel regulatory mechanisms.

A key challenge in the analysis of single-cell multimodal data is to devise appropriate strategies for tying together data across different modalities. The term ‘data integration’ has been used to describe this task, encompassing a broad collection of approaches ranging from batch correction of individual omics datasets to association of chromatin accessibility and genetic variation with transcription. Although existing integration strategies exploit similar mathematical ideas, they typically have distinct goals and rely on different principles and assumptions. Consequently, new definitions and concepts are needed to contextualize existing methods and to enable development of new methods.

UnionCom does not require any correspondence information, either among cells or among features. It first embeds the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of each single-cell dataset into a distance matrix of cells within the same dataset and then aligns the cells across single-cell multi-omics datasets by matching the distance matrices via a matrix optimization method. Finally, it projects the distinct unmatched features across single-cell datasets into a common embedding space for feature comparability of the aligned cells. To match the complex non-linear geometrical distorted low-dimensional structures across datasets, UnionCom proposes and adjusts a global scaling parameter on distance matrices for aligning similar topological structures. It does not require one-to-one correspondence among cells across datasets, and it can accommodate samples with dataset-specific cell types. UnionCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real single-cell multi-omics datasets. UnionCom is robust to parameter choices, as well as subsampling of features.	numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, torch, umap-learn	MNN, Seurat, MMD-MA, Harmony, scAlign	Unsupervised topological alignment for single-cell multi-omics integration	53.36353244	28.42628391	12.12256707	10.1101/2020.02.02.931394	4	Cao K, Bai X, Hong Y, Wan L.

Although several methods have demonstrated promising results in integrating several data modalities from the same tissue, the complexity and scale of data compositions present in cell atlases still pose a challenge. Here, we present scJoint, a transfer learning method to integrate atlas-scale, heterogeneous collections of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. scJoint leverages information from annotated scRNA-seq data in a semisupervised framework and uses a neural network to simultaneously train labeled and unlabeled data, allowing label transfer and joint visualization in an integrative framework. Using atlas data as well as multimodal datasets generated with ASAP-seq and CITE-seq, we demonstrate that scJoint is computationally efficient and consistently achieves substantially higher cell-type label accuracy than existing methods while providing meaningful joint visualizations. Thus, scJoint overcomes the heterogeneity of different data modalities to enable a more comprehensive understanding of cellular phenotypes.	datetime, h5py, itertools, numpy, os, random, scipy, sys, time, torch	Seurat, Conos, Liger	scJoint integrates atlas-scale single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data with transfer learning	73.62895818	43.28671722	14.45967638	None	7	Lin Y, Wu TY, Wan S, Yang JY, Wong WH, Wang YX. scJoint integrates atlas-scale single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data with transfer learning.

We introduce MultiMAP, a novel algorithm for dimensionality reduction and integration. MultiMAP can integrate any number of datasets, leverages features not present in all datasets, is not restricted to a linear mapping, allows the user to specify the influence of each dataset, and is extremely scalable to large datasets. We apply MultiMAP to single-cell transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility, methylation, and spatial data and show that it outperforms current approaches. On a new thymus dataset, we use MultiMAP to integrate cells along a temporal trajectory. This enables quantitative comparison of transcription factor expression and binding site accessibility over the course of T cell differentiation, revealing patterns of expression versus binding site opening kinetics.	annoy, numba, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy	Seurat, Liger, iNMF, Conos, GLUER	MultiMAP: dimensionality reduction and integration of multimodal data	77.60594622	43.08483533	14.80850612	10.1101/2021.02.16.431421	4	Jain MS, Polanski K, Conde CD, Chen X, Park J, Mamanova L, Knights A, Botting RA, Stephenson E, Haniffa M, Lamacraft A.

Here, we develop BROCKMAN (Brockman Representation Of Chromatin by K-mers in Mark-Associated Nucleotides), an approach to infer variation in transcription factor (TF) activity across samples through unsupervised analysis of the variation in DNA sequences associated with an epigenomic mark. Results: BROCKMAN represents each sample as a vector of epigenomic-mark-associated DNA word frequencies, and decomposes the resulting matrix to find hidden structure in the data, followed by unsupervised grouping of samples and identification of the TFs that distinguish groups. Applied to single cell ATAC-seq, BROCKMAN readily distinguished cell types, treatments, batch effects, experimental artifacts, and cycling cells. We show that each variable component in the k-mer landscape reflects a set of co-varying TFs, which are often known to physically interact. For example, in K562 cells, AP-1 TFs were central determinant of variability in chromatin accessibility through their variable expression levels and diverse interactions with other TFs. We provide a theoretical basis for why cooperative TF binding – and any associated epigenomic mark – is inherently more variable than non-cooperative binding. Conclusions: BROCKMAN and related approaches will help gain a mechanistic understanding of the trans determinants of chromatin variability between cells, treatments, and individuals.	ggplot2, jackstraw, tsne	None	BROCKMAN: deciphering variance in epigenomic regulators by k-mer factorization	3.045220718	3.977978872	3.44180093	None	3	de Boer CG, Regev A.

Several methods have been developed for reconstructing developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomic data, but efforts on analyzing single-cell epigenomic data and on trajectory visualization remain limited. Here we present STREAM, an interactive pipeline capable of disentangling and visualizing complex branching trajectories from both single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data. We have tested STREAM on several synthetic and real datasets generated with different single-cell technologies. We further demonstrate its utility for understanding myoblast differentiation and disentangling known heterogeneity in hematopoiesis for different organisms.

PRISM	R	16	differential feature analysis, dimensionality reduction	dimensionality reduction, differential feature analysis	An R package for calculating cell-to- cell variation in chromatin accessibility using cosine similarity.	10.3389/fgene.2018.00319	Frontiers in Genetics	Published	https://github.com/VahediLab/PRISM	2022.11.13	2022.11.13	2017.12.06	principal component analysis	CAS	2018.08.15	None	0		6	1	Cellular identity between generations of developing cells is propagated through the epigenome particularly via the accessible parts of the chromatin. It is now possible to measure chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution using single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq), which can reveal the regulatory variation behind the phenotypic variation. However, single-cell chromatin accessibility data are sparse, binary, and high dimensional, leading to unique computational challenges. To overcome these difficulties, we developed PRISM, a computational workflow that quantifies cell-to-cell chromatin accessibility variation while controlling for technical biases. PRISM is a novel multidimensional scaling-based method using angular cosine distance metrics coupled with distance from the spatial centroid. PRISM takes differences in accessibility at each genomic region between single cells into account. Using data generated in our lab and publicly available, we showed that PRISM outperforms an existing algorithm, which relies on the aggregate of signal across a set of genomic regions. PRISM showed robustness to noise in cells with low coverage for measuring chromatin accessibility. Our approach revealed the previously undetected accessibility variation where accessible sites differ between cells but the total number of accessible sites is constant. We also showed that PRISM, but not an existing algorithm, can find suppressed heterogeneity of accessibility at CTCF binding sites. Our updated approach uncovers new biological results with profound implications on the cellular heterogeneity of chromatin architecture.

Although techniques have been developed to assess binding profiles within a population of cells, determining them at a single-cell level remains elusive. Here, we report scFAN (single-cell factor analysis network),  a  deep  learning  model  that  predicts  genome-wide  TF  binding  profiles  in  individual  cells.  scFAN  is  pretrained on genome-wide bulk assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), DNA sequence, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data and uses single-cell ATAC-seq to predict TF binding in individual cells. We demonstrate the efficacy of scFAN by both studying sequence motifs enriched within predicted binding peaks and using predicted TFs for discovering cell types. We develop a new metric “TF activity score” to characterize each cell and show that activity scores can reliably capture cell identities. scFAN allows us to discover and study cellular identities and heterogeneity based on chromatin accessibility profiles.	collections, h5py, keras, numpy, pybedtools, pyfasta, scipy, theano, ucsc-bigwigmerge	Brockman, chromVAR, scABC, cisTopic, SCALE, Cicero, Peaks	Predicting transcription factor binding in single cells through deep learning	35.9273765	21.3510377	12.61961232	None	7	Fu L, Zhang L, Dollinger E, Peng Q, Nie Q, Xie X.

However, data from multiple sources frequently show strong technical variations, which is referred to as batch effects. In order to perform joint analysis across multiple datasets, specialized method is required to remove technical variations between datasets while keep biological information. Results: Here we present an algorithm named epiConv to perform joint analyses on scATAC-seq datasets. We first show that epiConv better corrects batch effects and is less prone to over-fitting problem than existing methods on a collection of PBMC datasets. In a collection of mouse brain data, we show that epiConv is capable of aligning low-depth scATAC-Seq from co-assay data (simultaneous profiling of transcriptome and chromatin) onto high-quality ATAC-seq reference and increasing the resolution of chromatin profiles of co-assay data. Finally, we show that epiConv can be used to integrate cells from different biological conditions (T cells in normal vs. germ-free mouse; normal vs. malignant hematopoiesis), which reveals hidden cell populations that would otherwise be undetectable. Conclusions: In this study, we introduce epiConv to integrate multiple scATAC-seq datasets and perform joint analysis on them. Through several case studies, we show that epiConv removes the batch effects and retains the biological signal. Moreover, joint analysis across multiple datasets improves the performance of clustering and differentially accessible peak calling, especially when the biological signal is weak in single dataset.	devtools	cisTopic, Harmony, Seurat, MNN, SCALE, snapATAC	Jointing analysis of scATAC-seq datasets using epiConv	8.933190521	10.03633215	10.36127647	10.1101/2020.02.13.947242	9	Lin L, Zhang L.

However, stochasticity and availability of low amount of relevant DNA, cause high drop-out rate and noise in single-cell open-chromatin profiles. We introduce here a robust method called as forest of imputation trees (FITs) to recover original signals from highly sparse and noisy single-cell open-chromatin profiles. FITs makes multiple imputation trees to avoid bias during the restoration of read-count matrices. It resolves the challenging issue of recovering open chromatin signals without blurring out information at genomic sites with cell-type-specific activity. Besides visualization and classification, FITs-based imputation also improved accuracy in the detection of enhancers, calculating pathway enrichment score and prediction of chromatin-interactions. FITs is generalized for wider applicability, especially for highly sparse read-count matrices. The superiority of FITs in recovering signals of minority cells also makes it highly useful for single-cell open-chromatin profile from in vivo samples.

However, application of these techniques to clinical tumor specimens has been hampered by the current inability to distinguish malignant from nonmalignant cells, which potently confounds data analysis and interpretation. Here, we describe Copy-scAT, an R package that uses single-cell epigenomic data to infer copy number variants (CNVs) that define cancer cells. Copy-scAT enables studies of sub-clonal chromatin dynamics in complex tumors like glioblastoma. By deploying Copy-scAT, we uncovered potent influences of genetics on chromatin accessibility profiles in individual subclones. Consequently, some genetic subclones were predisposed to acquire stem-like or more differentiated molecular phenotypes, reminiscent of developmental paradigms. Copy-scAT is ideal for studies of the relationships between genetics and epigenetics in malignancies with high levels of intratumoral heterogeneity and to investigate how cancer cells interface with their microenvironme	NMF, Rtsne, edgeR	pGBM, scCNV	Copy-scAT: Deconvoluting single-cell chromatin accessibility of genetic subclones in cancer	49.88435402	25.75745065	9.859885839	10.1101/2020.09.21.305516	3	Nikolic A, Singhal D, Ellestad K, Johnston M, Shen Y, Gillmor A, Morrissy S, Cairncross JG, Jones S, Lupien M, Chan JA.

However, currently available cis-regulatory network prediction methods using single-cell open-chromatin profiles focus more on local chromatin interactions despite the fact that long-range interactions among genomic sites play a significant role in gene regulation. Here, we propose a method that predicts both short and long-range interactions among genomic sites using single-cell open chromatin profiles. Our method, termed as single-cell epigenome based chromatin-interaction analysis (scEChIA) exploits signal imputation and refined L1 regularization. For a few single-cell open-chromatin profiles, scEChIA outperformed other tools even in terms of accuracy of prediction. Using scEChIA, we predicted almost 0.7 million interactions among genomic sites across seven cell types in the human brain. Further analysis revealed cell type for connection between genes and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) in the human brain and making insight about target genes of human-acceleratedelements and disease-associated mutations. Our analysis enabled by scEChIA also hints about the possible action of a few transcription factors (TFs), especially through long-range interaction in brain endothelial cells.	glassoFast, nor1mix, pracma, roxygen2, varbvs	Cicero	Improving Chromatin-Interaction Prediction Using Single-Cell Open-Chromatin Profiles and Making Insight Into the Cis-Regulatory Landscape of the Human Brain	3.144728282	4.866441709	4.549662563	10.1101/2020.12.29.424732	4	Pandey N, Chandra O, Mishra S, Kumar V.

However, it is difficult to benchmark the performance of various scATAC-seq analysis techniques (such as clustering and deconvolution) without having a priori a known set of gold-standard cell types. To simulate scATAC-seq experiments with known cell-type labels, we introduce an efficient and scalable scATAC-seq simulation method (SCAN-ATACSim) that down-samples bulk ATAC-seq data (e.g. from representative cell lines or tissues). Our protocol uses a consistent but tunable signal-to-noise ratio across cell types in a scATAC-seq simulation for integrating bulk experiments with different levels of background noise, and it independently samples twice without replacement to account for the diploid genome. Because it uses an efficient weighted reservoir sampling algorithm and is highly parallelizable with OpenMP, our implementation in Cþþ allows millions of cells to be simulated in less than an hour on a laptop computer.	pyBigWig, pybedtools, pysam	None	SCAN-ATAC-Sim: a scalable and efficient method for simulating single-cell ATAC-seq data from bulk-tissue experiments	1.107582068	1.58052959	2.370794385	None	0	Chen Z, Zhang J, Liu J, Zhang Z, Zhu J, Lee D, Xu M, Gerstein M.

However, computational modeling of scATAC-seq data is challenging due to its high dimension, extreme sparsity, complex dependencies and high sensitivity to confounding factors from various sources. Results: Here, we propose a new deep generative model framework, named SAILER, for analyzing scATAC-seq data. SAILER aims to learn a low-dimensional nonlinear latent representation of each cell that defines its intrinsic chromatin state, invariant to extrinsic confounding factors like read depth and batch effects. SAILER adopts the conventional encoder-decoder framework to learn the latent representation but imposes additional constraints to ensure the independence of the learned representations from the confounding factors. Experimental results on both simulated and real scATAC-seq datasets demonstrate that SAILER learns better and biologically more meaningful representations of cells than other methods. Its noise-free cell embeddings bring in significant benefits in downstream analyses: clustering and imputation based on SAILER result in 6.9% and 18.5% improvements over existing methods, respectively. Moreover, because no matrix factorization is involved, SAILER can easily scale to process millions of cells. We implemented SAILER into a software package, freely available to all for large-scale scATAC-seq data analysis.

In this study, we propose a universal framework for the integration of single-cell multi-omics data based on graph convolutional network (GCN-SC). Among the multiple single-cell data, GCNSC usually selects one data with the largest number of cells as the reference and the rest as the query dataset. It utilizes mutual nearest neighbor algorithm to identify cell-pairs, which provide connections between cells both within and across the reference and query datasets. A GCN algorithm further takes the mixed graph constructed from these cell-pairs to adjust count matrices from the query datasets. Finally, dimension reduction is performed by using non-negative matrix factorization before visualization. By applying GCNSC on six datasets, we show that GCN-SC can effectively integrate sequencing data from multiple single-cell sequencing technologies, species or different omics, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including Seurat, LIGER, GLUER and Pamona.	numpy, sklearn, pandas, nimfa, pytorch	scImpute, Seurat, LIGER, GLUER, Pamona	A universal framework for single-cell multi-omics data integration with graph convolutional networks	7.6461373685212	5.69679171618821	8.14925779253153	None	2.0	Gao H, Zhang B, Liu L, Li S, Gao X, Yu B.

Here, we present SCALEX, a deep-learning method that integrates single-cell data by projecting cells into a batch-invariant, common cell-embedding space in a truly online manner (i.e., without retraining the model). SCALEX substantially outperforms online iNMF and other state-of-the-art non-online integration methods on benchmark single-cell datasets of diverse modalities, (e.g., single-cell RNA sequencing, scRNA-seq, single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin use sequencing, scATAC-seq), especially for datasets with partial overlaps, accurately aligning similar cell populations while retaining true biological differences. We showcase SCALEX’s advantages by constructing continuously expandable single-cell atlases for human, mouse, and COVID-19 patients, each assembled from diverse data sources and growing with every new data. The online data integration capacity and superior performance makes SCALEX particularly appropriate for large-scale single-cell applications to build upon previous scientific insights.	leidenalg, torch	Seurat, Harmony, scVI, iNMF, MNN, Conos, BBKNN, Scanorama, Liger	Online single-cell data integration through projecting heterogeneous datasets into a common cell-embedding space	81.10741951	43.78832376	17.62088686	10.1101/2021.04.06.438536	3	Xiong L, Tian K, Li Y, Ning W, Gao X, Zhang QC.

The Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) generates reads from regulatory sequences and could potentially be used as a low-cost ‘capture’ method for regulatory variant discovery, but its use for this purpose has not been systematically evaluated. Here we apply seven variant callers to bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq data and evaluate their ability to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (indels). In addition, we develop an ensemble classifier, VarCA, which combines features from individual variant callers to predict variants. The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is the best-performing individual caller with precision/recall on a bulk ATAC test dataset of 0.92/0.97 for SNVs and 0.87/0.82 for indels within ATAC-seq peak regions with at least 10 reads. On bulk ATAC-seq reads, VarCA achieves superior performance with precision/recall of 0.99/0.95 for SNVs and 0.93/0.80 for indels. On single-cell ATAC-seq reads, VarCA attains precision/recall of 0.98/0.94 for SNVs and 0.82/0.82 for indels. In summary, ATAC-seq reads can be used to accurately discover non-coding regulatory variants in the absence of whole-genome sequencing data and our ensemble method, VarCA, has the best overall performance.	snakemake	GATK, VarScan, VarDict, Pindel, Strelka	Discovering single nucleotide variants and indels from bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq	27.29744214	16.56018632	8.403071114	None	1	Massarat AR, Sen A, Jaureguy J, Tyndale ST, Fu Y, Erikson G, McVicker G.

However, the current great sparsity of the resulting data poses significant challenges to their interpretability and informativeness. Different computational methods are available, proposing ways to generate significant features from accessibility data and process them to obtain meaningful results. In particular, the most common way to interpret the raw scATAC-seq data is through peak-calling, generating the peaks as features. Nevertheless, this method is dataset-dependent because the peaks are related to the given dataset and can not be directly compared between different experiments. For this reason, this study wants to improve on the concept of the Gene Activity Matrix (GAM), which links the accessibility data to the genes, by proposing a Genomic-Annotated Gene Activity Matrix (GAGAM), which aims to label the peaks and link them to the genes through functional annotation of the whole genome. Using genes as features solves the problem of the feature dataset dependency allowing for the link of gene accessibility and expression. The latter is crucial for gene regulation understanding and fundamental for the increasing impact of multi-omics data. Results confirm that our method performs better than the previous GAMs.	Not Applicable	GeneScoring, Cicero	GAGAM: a genomic annotation-based enrichment of scATAC-seq data for Gene Activity Matrix	4.079028311	5.905371081	5.758056622	10.1101/2022.01.24.477458	5	Martini L, Bardini R, Savino A, Di Carlo S.

The identification and characterization of cellular heterogeneity are typically achieved through unsupervised clustering, which crucially relies on a similarity metric. Results: We here propose the use of Optimal Transport (OT) as a cell–cell similarity metric for single-cell omics data. OT defines distances to compare high-dimensional data represented as probability distributions. To speed up computations and cope with the high dimensionality of single-cell data, we consider the entropic regularization of the classical OT distance. We then extensively benchmark OT against state-of-the-art metrics over 13 independent datasets, including simulated, scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and single-cell DNA methylation data. First, we test the ability of the metrics to detect the similarity between cells belonging to the same groups (e.g. cell types, cell lines of origin). Then, we apply unsupervised clustering and test the quality of the resulting clusters. OT is found to improve cell–cell similarity inference and cell clustering in all simulated and real scRNA-seq data, as well as in scATAC-seq and single-cell DNA methylation data.

Here, we present single-cell aggregation of cell-states (SEACells), an algorithm for identifying metacells; overcoming the sparsity of single-cell data, while retaining heterogeneity obscured by traditional cell clustering. SEACells outperforms existing algorithms in identifying accurate, compact, and well-separated metacells in both RNA and ATAC modalities across datasets with discrete cell types and continuous trajectories. We demonstrate the use of SEACells to improve gene-peak associations, compute ATAC gene scores and measure gene accessibility in each metacell. Metacell-level analysis scales to large datasets and are particularly well suited for patient cohorts, including facilitation of data integration. We use our metacells to reveal expression dynamics and gradual reconfiguration of the chromatin landscape during hematopoietic differentiation, and to uniquely identify CD4 T cell differentiation and activation states associated with disease onset and severity in a COVID-19 patient cohort.	anndata, louvain	Super-cells, Baran et al	SEACells: Inference of transcriptional and epigenomic cellular states from single-cell genomics data	57.84626323	35.75962867	11.61394018	10.1101/2022.04.02.486748	5	Persad S, Choo ZN, Dien C, Masilionis I, Chaligné R, Nawy T, Brown CC, Pe'er I, Setty M, Pe'er D.

Here we present a novel algorithm, epiAneufinder, that exploits the read count information from scATAC-seq data to extract genome-wide copy number variations (CNVs) for individual cells, allowing to explore the CNV heterogeneity present in a sample at the single-cell level. Using different cancer scATAC-seq datasets, we show how epiAneufinder can identify intratumor clonal heterogeneity in populations of single cells based on their CNV profiles. These profiles are concordant with the ones inferred from single-cell whole genome sequencing data for the same samples. epiAneufinder allows the addition of single-cell CNV information to scATAC-seq data, without the need of additional experiments, unlocking a layer of genomic variation which is otherwise unexplored.

One fundamental challenge in this context is to find the target genes whose expression the regulatory regions affect. A recent successful method is the Activity-By-Contact (ABC) model [10] which scores enhancer-gene interactions based on enhancer activity and the contact frequency of an enhancer to its target gene. It requires two types of assays to measure enhancer activity, which limits the applicability. The ABC score describes regulatory interactions entirely from a gene’s perspective, and does not account for all the candidate target genes of an enhancer. Moreover, there is no implementation available which would allow for an integration with transcription factor (TF) binding information or an efficient analysis of single-cell data. We show that the ABC-model is comparably accurate with only one assay to measure enhancer activity. Further, we demonstrate that it can yield a higher accuracy by adapting the enhancer activity according to the number of contacts the enhancer has to its candidate target genes. We combined our adapted ABC-model with TF binding information and illustrate an analysis of a single-cell ATAC-seq data set of the human heart. We were able to characterise cell type-specific regulatory interactions as well as to prioritise candidate TFs that drive cell type-specific expression. All executed processing steps are incorporated into our new computational pipeline STARE. The software is available at https://github.com/schulzlab/STARE.

SELMA	Python	0	imputation, other	intrinsic bias estimation, imputation	A computational framework for the accurate estimation of intrinsic cleavage biases and improved analysis of DNase/ATAC-seq data for both bulk and single-cell experiments.	10.1038/s41467-022-33194-z	Nature Communications	Published	https://github.com/zang-lab/SELMA	2022.11.17	2022.11.17	2022.09.05	linear regression	CAS	2022.09.21	AGPL	0		2	5	Genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility by DNase-seq or ATAC-seq has been widely used to identify regulatory DNA elements and transcription factor binding sites. However, enzymatic DNA cleavage exhibits intrinsic sequence biases that confound chromatin accessibility profiling data analysis. Existing computational tools are limited in their ability to account for such intrinsic biases and not designed for analyzing single-cell data. Here, we pre- sent Simplex Encoded Linear Model for Accessible Chromatin (SELMA), a computational method for systematic estimation of intrinsic cleavage biases from genomic chromatin accessibility profiling data. We demonstrate that SELMA yields accurate and robust bias estimation from both bulk and single- cell DNase-seq and ATAC-seq data. SELMA can utilize internal mitochondrial DNA data to improve bias estimation. We show that transcription factor binding inference from DNase footprints can be improved by incorporating estimated biases using SELMA. Furthermore, we show strong effects of intrinsic biases in single-cell ATAC-seq data, and develop the first single-cell ATAC-seq intrinsic bias correction model to improve cell clustering. SELMA can enhance the performance of existing bioinformatics tools and improve the analysis of both bulk and single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing data.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified > 400 independent signals that encode genetic predisposition. More than 90% of associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) localize to non-coding regions and are enriched in chromatin-defined islet enhancer elements, indicating a strong transcriptional regulatory component to disease susceptibility. Pancreatic islets are a mixture of cell types that express distinct hormonal programs, so each cell type may contribute differentially to the underlying regulatory processes that modulate T2Dassociated transcriptional circuits. Existing chromatin profiling methods such as ATAC-seq and DNase-seq, applied to islets in bulk, produce aggregate profiles that mask important cellular and regulatory heterogeneity. Methods: We present genome-wide single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles in >1,600 cells derived from a human pancreatic islet sample using single-cell combinatorial indexing ATAC-seq (sci-ATAC-seq). We also developed a deep learning model based on U-Net architecture to accurately predict open chromatin peak calls in rare cell populations. Results: We show that sci-ATAC-seq profiles allow us to deconvolve alpha, beta, and delta cell populations and identify cell-type-specific regulatory signatures underlying T2D. Particularly, T2D GWAS SNPs are significantly enriched in beta cell-specific and across cell-type shared islet open chromatin, but not in alpha or delta cell-specific open chromatin. We also demonstrate, using less abundant delta cells, that deep learning models can improve signal recovery and feature reconstruction of rarer cell populations. Finally, we use co-accessibility measures to nominate the cell-specific target genes at 104 non-coding T2D GWAS signals. Conclusions: Collectively, we identify the islet cell type of action across genetic signals of T2D predisposition and provide higher-resolution mechanistic insights into genetically encoded risk pathways	Not Applicable	None	Single-cell ATAC-Seq in human pancreatic islets and deep learning upscaling of rare cells reveals cell-specific type 2 diabetes regulatory signatures	5.931406561	8.057200809	5.542346154	10.1101/749283	7	Rai V, Quang DX, Erdos MR, Cusanovich DA, Daza RM, Narisu N, Zou LS, Didion JP, Guan Y, Shendure J, Parker SC.

Bulk approaches have characterized the wide repertoire of histone modifications across cell types, detailing their role in shaping cell identity. However, these population-based methods do not capture cell-to-cell heterogeneity of chromatin landscapes, limiting our appreciation of the role of chromatin in dynamic biological processes. Recent technological developments enable the mapping of histone marks at single-cell resolution, opening up perspectives to characterize the heterogeneity of chromatin marks in complex biological systems over time. Yet, existing tools used to analyze bulk histone modifications profiles are not fit for the low coverage and sparsity of single-cell epigenomic datasets. Here, we present ChromSCape, a user-friendly interactive Shiny/R application distributed as a Bioconductor package, that processes single-cell epigenomic data to assist the biological interpretation of chromatin landscapes within cell populations. ChromSCape analyses the distribution of repressive and active histone modifications as well as chromatin accessibility landscapes from single-cell datasets. Using ChromSCape, we deconvolve chromatin landscapes within the tumor micro-environment, identifying distinct H3K27me3 landscapes associated with cell identity and breast tumor subtype.

As there is an increasing need for single-cell omics data to be integrated across sources, types and features of data, the challenges of integrating single-cell omics data are rising. Here, we present an unsupervised deep learning algorithm that learns discriminative representations for single-cell data via maximizing mutual information, SMILE (Single-cell Mutual Information Learning). Results: Using a unique cell-pairing design, SMILE successfully integrates multisource single-cell transcriptome data, removing batch effects and projecting similar cell types, even from different tissues, into the shared space. SMILE can also integrate data from two or more modalities, such as joint-profiling technologies using single-cell ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, DNA methylation, Hi-C and ChIP data. When paired cells are known, SMILE can integrate data with unmatched feature, such as genes for RNA-seq and genome-wide peaks for ATAC-seq. Integrated representations learned from joint-profiling technologies can then be used as a framework for comparing independent single source data.

The high dimensionality, sparsity, and inaccuracy of single cell sequencing measurements, however, can obscure discriminatory information, mask cellular subtype variations and complicate downstream analyses which can limit our understanding of cell function and tissue heterogeneity. Here, we present a novel pre-processing method (scPSD) inspired by power spectral density analysis that enhances the accuracy for cell subtype separation from large-scale single-cell omics data. We comprehensively benchmarked our method on a wide range of single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets and showed that scPSD pre-processing, while being fast and scalable, significantly reduces data complexity, enhances cell-type separation, and enables rare cell identification. Additionally, we applied scPSD to transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility cell atlases and demonstrated its capacity to discriminate over 100 cell types across the whole organism and across different modalities of single-cell omics data.

While recent unsupervised algorithms align single-cell multi-omic datasets, these methods have been primarily benchmarked on co-assay experiments rather than the more common single-cell experiments taken from separately sampled cell populations. Therefore, most existing methods perform subpar alignments on such datasets. Here, we improve our previous work Single Cell alignment using Optimal Transport (SCOT) by using unbalanced optimal transport to handle disproportionate cell-type representation and differing sample sizes across single-cell measurements. We show that our proposed method, SCOTv2, consistently yields quality alignments on five real-world single-cell datasets with varying cell-type proportions and is computationally tractable. Additionally, we extend SCOTv2 to integrate multiple (M ≥ 2) single-cell measurements and present a self-tuning heuristic process to select hyperparameters in the absence of any orthogonal correspondence information.

However, harmonizing such datasets requires integration approaches to be not only computationally scalable, but also capable of preserving a wide range of fine-grained cell populations. We have created Portal, a unified framework of adversarial domain translation to learn harmonized representations of datasets. When compared to other state-of-the-art methods, Portal achieves better performance for preserving biological variation during integration, while achieving the integration of millions of cells, in minutes, with low memory consumption. We show that Portal is widely applicable to integrating datasets across different samples, platforms and data types. We also apply Portal to the integration of cross-species datasets with limited shared information among them, elucidating biological insights into the similarities and divergences in the spermatogenesis process among mouse, macaque and human.	torch, scanpy	Harmony, Seurat, iNMF, VIPCCA	Adversarial domain translation networks for integrating large-scale atlas-level single-cell datasets	42.5774825	22.02664641	9.66994785	10.1101/2021.11.16.468892	1	Zhao J, Wang G, Ming J, Lin Z, Wang Y, Wu AR, Yang C.

We benchmarked sciCAN with 5 existing methods in 5 scATAC-seq/scRNA-seq datasets, and we demonstrated that our method dealt with data integration with consistent performance across datasets and better balance of mutual transferring between modalities than the other 5 existing methods. We further applied sciCAN to 10X Multiome data and confirmed that the integrated representation preserves biological relationships within the hematopoietic hierarchy. Finally, we investigated CRISPR-perturbed single-cell K562 ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data to identify cells with related responses to different perturbations in these different modalities.	torch	Liger, Harmony, Seurat, ArchR, SMILE	sciCAN: Single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression data integration via Cycle-consistent Adversarial Network	11.09752279	10.39280028	9.612179691	10.1101/2021.11.30.470677	7	Xu Y, Begoli E, McCord RP. sciCAN: single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression data integration via cycle-consistent adversarial network.

When dealing with such multi-omics data, the first step is to determine the correspondence among different modalities. In other words, we should match data from different spaces corresponding to the same object. This problem is particularly challenging in the single-cell multi-omics scenario because such data are very sparse with extremely high dimensions. Secondly, matched single-cell multi-omics data are rare and hard to collect. Furthermore, due to the limitations of the experimental environment, the data are usually highly noisy. To promote the single-cell multi-omics research, we overcome the above challenges, proposing a novel framework to align and integrate single-cell RNA-seq data and single-cell ATAC-seq data. Our approach can efficiently map the above data with high sparsity and noise from different spaces to a low-dimensional manifold in a unified space, making the downstream alignment and integration straightforward. Compared with the other state-of-the-art methods, our method performs better in both simulated and real single-cell data. The proposed method is helpful for the single-cell multi-omics research. The improvement for integration on the simulated data is significant.	torch	scanpy, Seurat, DCCA, Cross-Modal, Cross-Modal-Anchor	Contrastive Cycle Adversarial Autoencoders for Single-cell Multi-omics Alignment and Integration	8.200330584	5.509132706	7.038130877	10.1101/2021.12.12.472268	2	Wang X, Hu Z, Yu T, Wang R, Wei Y, Shu J, Ma J, Li Y.

To analyze the multi-modality data, common tasks such as joint data analysis and cross-modal prediction have been developed. However, current analytical methods are generally designed to process multi-modality data for one specific task without considering the underlying connections between tasks. Here, we present UnitedNet, a multi-task deep neural network that integrates the tasks of joint group identification and cross-modal prediction to analyze multi-modality data. We have found that multi-task learning for joint group identification and cross-modal prediction significantly improves the performance of each task. When applied to various single-cell multi-modality datasets, UnitedNet shows superior performance in each task, achieving better unsupervised and supervised joint group identification and cross-modal prediction performances compared with state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, by considering the spatial information of cells as one modality, UnitedNet substantially improves the accuracy of tissue region identification and enables spatially resolved cross-modal prediction.

Although great efforts have been devoted to either of them, the integrative analysis of single-cell multi-omics data is really limited because of the heterogeneity, noises and sparsity of single-cell profiles. In this study, a network-based integrative clustering algorithm (aka NIC) is present for the identification of cell types by fusing the parallel single-cell transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) and epigenomic profiles (scATAC-seq or DNA methylation). To avoid heterogeneity of multi-omics data, NIC automatically learns the cell–cell similarity graphs, which transforms the fusion of multi-omics data into the analysis of multiple networks. Then, NIC employs joint non-negative matrix factorization to learn the shared features of cells by exploiting the structure of learned cell–cell similarity networks, providing a better way to characterize the features of cells. The graph learning and integrative analysis procedures are jointly formulated as an optimization problem, and then the update rules are derived. Thirteen single-cell multi-omics datasets from various tissues and organisms are adopted to validate the performance of NIC, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of various measurements. The proposed algorithm provides an effective strategy for the integrative analysis of single-cell multi-omics data (The software is coded using Matlab, and is freely available for academic https://github.com/xkmaxidian/NIC ).

A major obstacle in integrating omics data from multiple modalities is that different omics layers typically have distinct feature spaces. Here, we propose a computational framework called GLUE (graph-linked unified embedding), which bridges the gap by modeling regulatory interactions across omics layers explicitly. Systematic benchmarking demonstrated that GLUE is more accurate, robust and scalable than state-of-the-art tools for heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics data. We applied GLUE to various challenging tasks, including triple-omics integration, integrative regulatory inference and multi-omics human cell atlas construction over millions of cells, where GLUE was able to correct previous annotations. GLUE features a modular design that can be flexibly extended and enhanced for new analysis tasks.

Determining how, where, and when TFs bind chromatin will advance our understanding of gene regulatory networks and cellular behavior. The 2017 ENCODE-DREAM in vivo Transcription-Factor Binding Site (TFBS) Prediction Challenge highlighted the value of chromatin accessibility data to TFBS prediction, establishing state-of-the-art methods for TFBS prediction from DNase-seq. However, the more recent Assay-for-Transposase-Accessible-Chromatin (ATAC)-seq has surpassed DNase-seq as the most widely-used chromatin accessibility profiling method. Furthermore, ATAC-seq is the only such technique available at single-cell resolution from standard commercial platforms. While ATAC-seq datasets grow exponentially, suboptimal motif scanning is unfortunately the most common method for TFBS prediction from ATAC-seq. To enable community access to state-of-the-art TFBS prediction from ATAC-seq, we (1) curated an extensive benchmark dataset (127 TFs) for ATAC-seq model training and (2) built “maxATAC”, a suite of user-friendly, deep neural network models for genome-wide TFBS prediction from ATAC-seq in any cell type. With models available for 127 human TFs, maxATAC is the largest collection of high-performance TFBS prediction models for ATAC-seq. maxATAC performance extends to primary cells and single-cell ATAC-seq, enabling improved TFBS prediction in vivo. We demonstrate maxATAC’s capabilities by identifying TFBS associated with allele-dependent chromatin accessibility at atopic dermatitis genetic risk loci.	bedtools, samtools	Factornet, Leopard, DeepGRN	maxATAC: Genome-scale transcription-factor binding prediction from ATAC-seq with deep neural networks	21.24645896	13.44845259	8.863638815	10.1101/2022.01.28.478235	2	Cazares TA, Rizvi FW, Iyer B, Chen X, Kotliar M, Bejjani AT, Wayman JA, Donmez O, Wronowski B, Parameswaran S, Kottyan LC. maxATAC: Genome-scale transcription-factor binding prediction from ATAC-Seq with deep neural networks.

Therefore, studying the functional characteristics and spatial distribution of genetically distinct subclones is crucial to the understanding of tumor evolution and the design of cancer treatment. Here, we present Clonalscope, a method for subclone detection using copy number profiles that can be applied to spatial transcriptomics (ST) data and data from single-cell sequencing platforms such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. Clonalscope implements a nested Chinese restaurant process to identify de novo subclones within one or multiple samples from the same patient. Clonalscope incorporates prior information from paired whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing (WGS/WES) data to achieve more reliable subclone detection and malignant cell labeling. On scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data from four gastrointestinal tumor samples, Clonalscope successfully labeled malignant cells and identified genetically different subclones, which were validated in detail using matched scDNA-seq data. On ST data from a squamous cell carcinoma and two invasive ductal carcinoma samples, Clonalscope successfully labelled malignant spots, traced subclones between associated datasets, and identified spatially segregated subclones expressing genes associated with drug resistance and survival.

However, existing methods cannot precisely uncover cell-type-specific binding of transcription regulators (TRs) and construct gene regulation networks (GRNs) in single-cell. ChIPseq has been widely used to profile TR binding sites in the past decades. Here, we developed SCRIP, an integrative method to infer single-cell TR activity and targets based on the integration of scATACseq and a large-scale TR ChIP-seq reference. Our method showed improved performance in evaluating TR binding activity compared to the existing motifbased methods and reached a higher consistency with matched TR expressions. Besides, our method enables identifying TR target genes as well as building GRNs at the single-cell resolution based on a regulatory potential model. We demonstrate SCRIP’s utility in accurate cell-type clustering, lineage tracing, and inferring cell-type-specific GRNs in multiple biological systems.

Our approach scales to arbitrarily large numbers of cells using fixed memory, iteratively incorporates new datasets as they are generated and allows many users to simultaneously analyze a single copy of a large dataset by streaming it over the internet. Iterative data addition can also be used to map new data to a reference dataset. Comparisons with previous methods indicate that the improvements in efficiency do not sacrifice dataset alignment and cluster preservation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of online iNMF by integrating more than 1 million cells on a standard laptop, integrating large single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic datasets, and iteratively constructing a single-cell multi-omic atlas of the mouse motor cortex.

Integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell datasets combines complementary information offered by single-omic datasets and can offer deeper insights on complex biological process. Clustering methods that identify the unknown cell types are among the first few steps in the analysis of single-cell datasets, and they are important for downstream analysis built upon the identified cell types.

In this study, we implemented a recently proposed tensor-decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) technique to address this difficult problem. The technique can successfully integrate single-cell multiomics data composed of gene expression, DNA methylation, and accessibility. Although the last two have large dimensions, as many as ten million, containing only a few percentage of nonzero values, TD-based unsupervised FE can integrate three omics datasets without filling in missing values. Together with UMAP, which is used frequently when embedding single-cell measurements into two-dimensional space, TD-based unsupervised FE can produce two-dimensional embedding coincident with classification when integrating single-cell omics datasets. Genes selected based on TD-based unsupervised FE are also significantly related to reasonable biological roles.

However, both the rows and the columns can represent different entities in different data matrices, making such integration a computational challenge that has only been solved approximately by existing approaches. Here, we present bindSC, a single-cell data integration tool that realizes simultaneous alignment of the rows and the columns between data matrices without making approximations. Using datasets produced by multiomics technologies as gold standard, we show that bindSC generates accurate multimodal co-embeddings that are substantially more accurate than those generated by existing approaches. Particularly, bindSC effectively integrated single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scATAC-seq) data towards discovering key regulatory elements in cancer cell-lines and mouse cells. It achieved accurate integration of both common and rare cell types (<0.25% abundance) in a novel mouse retina cell atlas generated using the 10x Genomics Multiome ATAC+RNA kit. Further, it achieves unbiased integration of scRNA-seq and 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics data derived from mouse brain cortex samples. Lastly, it demonstrated efficacy in delineating immune cell types via integrating single-cell RNA and protein data. Thus, bindSC, available at https://github.com/KChen-lab/bindSC, can be applied in a broad variety of context to accelerate discovery of complex cellular and biological identities and associated molecular underpinnings in diseases and developing organisms.	irlba	CCA, Seurat, Liger, Harmony	Unbiased integration of single cell multi-omics data	35.57877698	21.84269784	9.420241832	10.1101/2020.12.11.422014	3	Dou J, Liang S, Mohanty V, Cheng X, Kim S, Choi J, Li Y, Rezvani K, Chen R, Chen K.

However, with the exception of a few of co-assaying technologies, it is not possible to simultaneously apply different sequencing assays on the same single cell. In this scenario, computational integration of multi-omic measurements is crucial to enable joint analyses. This integration task is particularly challenging due to the lack of sample-wise or feature-wise correspondences. We present single-cell alignment with optimal transport (SCOT), an unsupervised algorithm that uses the Gromov–Wasserstein optimal transport to align single-cell multi-omics data sets. SCOT performs on par with the current state-of-the-art unsupervised alignment methods, is faster, and requires tuning of fewer hyperparameters. More importantly, SCOT uses a self-tuning heuristic to guide hyperparameter selection based on the Gromov–Wasserstein distance. Thus, in the fully unsupervised setting, SCOT aligns single-cell data sets better than the existing methods without requiring any orthogonal correspondence information.

However, effective approaches for the integrative analysis of such data are challenging. Existing manifold alignment methods demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance on single-cell multi-omics data integration, but they are often limited by requiring that single-cell datasets be derived from the same underlying cellular structure. Results: In this study, we present Pamona, a partial Gromov-Wasserstein distance-based manifold alignment framework that integrates heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics datasets with the aim of delineating and representing the shared and dataset-specific cellular structures across modalities. We formulate this task as a partial manifold alignment problem and develop a partial Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport framework to solve it. Pamona identifies both shared and dataset-specific cells based on the computed probabilistic couplings of cells across datasets, and it aligns cellular modalities in a common low-dimensional space, while simultaneously preserving both shared and dataset-specific structures. Our framework can easily incorporate prior information, such as cell type annotations or cell-cell correspondence, to further improve alignment quality. We evaluated Pamona on a comprehensive set of publicly available benchmark datasets. We demonstrated that Pamona can accurately identify shared and dataset-specific cells, as well as faithfully recover and align cellular structures of heterogeneous single-cell modalities in a common space, outperforming the comparable existing methods.

In addition to genetic diversity, the cell-to-cell variation that fuels evolutionary selection also manifests in cellular states, epigenetic profiles, spatial distributions and interactions with the microenvironment. Therefore, the study of cancer requires the integration of multiple heritable dimensions at the resolution of the single cell — the atomic unit of somatic evolution. In this Review, we discuss emerging analytic and experimental technologies for single-cell multi-omics that enable the capture and integration of multiple data modalities to inform the study of cancer evolution. These data show that cancer results from a complex interplay between genetic and non-genetic determinants of somatic evolution.

Existing methods tend to use a pre-defined gene activity matrix to convert the scATAC-seq data into scRNA-seq data. The pre-defined gene activity matrix is often of low quality and does not reflect the dataset-specific relationship between the two data modalities. We propose scDART, a deep learning framework that integrates scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data and learns cross-modalities relationships simultaneously. Specifically, the design of scDART allows it to preserve cell trajectories in continuous cell populations and can be applied to trajectory inference on integrated data.	torch, scipy, seaborn	Liger, Seurat, UnionCom, MMD-MA, scJoint	Integrating unmatched scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data and learning cross-modality relationship simultaneously	35.84335436	18.21581139	10.46869008	10.1101/2021.04.16.440230	3	Zhang Z, Yang C, Zhang X. scDART: integrating unmatched scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data and learning cross-modality relationship simultaneously.

Many analyses require “mosaic integration”, including both features shared across datasets and features exclusive to a single experiment. Previous computational integration approaches require that the input matrices share the same number of either genes or cells, and thus can use only shared features. To address this limitation, we derive a nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm for integrating single-cell datasets containing both shared and unshared features. The key advance is incorporating an additional metagene matrix that allows unshared features to inform the factorization. We demonstrate that incorporating unshared features significantly improves integration of single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomic, SNARE-seq, and cross-species datasets. We have incorporated the UINMF algorithm into the open-source LIGER R package (https://github.com/welch-lab/liger).	liger	Harmony, iNMF, Seurat	UINMF performs mosaic integration of single-cell multi-omic datasets using nonnegative matrix factorization	299.7973304	178.5662024	34.87670935	10.1101/2021.04.09.439160	1	Kriebel AR, Welch JD.

While each single-modality assay reveals distinctive features about the sequenced cells, true multi-omics assays are still in early stage of development. This notion signifies the importance of computationally integrating single-cell omics data that are conducted on various samples across various modalities. In addition, the advent of multiplexed molecular imaging assays has given rise to a need for computational methods for integrative analysis of single-cell imaging and omics data. Here, we present GLUER (inteGrative anaLysis of mUlti-omics at single-cEll Resolution), a flexible tool for integration of single-cell multi-omics data and imaging data. Using multiple true multi-omics data sets as the ground truth, we demonstrate that GLUER achieved significant improvement over existing methods in terms of the accuracy of matching cells across different data modalities resulting in ameliorating downstream analyses such as clustering and trajectory inference. We further demonstrate the broad utility of GLUER for integrating single-cell transcriptomics data with imaging-based spatial proteomics and transcriptomics data. Finally, we extend GLUER to leverage true cell-pair labels when available in true multi-omics data, and show that this approach improves co-embedding and clustering results. With the rapid accumulation of single-cell multi-omics and imaging data, integrated data holds the promise of furthering our understanding of the role of heterogeneity in development and disease.	scanpy	Liger, Seurat	GLUER: integrative analysis of single-cell omics and imaging data by deep neural network	12.62249717	11.09250122	6.96840405	10.1101/2021.01.25.427845	6	Peng T, Chen GM, Tan K.

However, while isolated modalities only capture one view of the total information of a biological cell, an integrative analysis capturing the different modalities is challenging. In response, bioinformatics and machine learning methodologies have been developed for multi-omics single-cell analysis. Nevertheless, it is unclear if current tools can address the dual aspect of modality integration and prediction across modalities without requiring extensive parameter finetuning. Results We designed LIBRA, a Neural Network based framework, to learn a translation between paired multi-omics profiles such that a shared latent space is constructed. LIBRA is a state-of-the-art tool when evaluating the ability to increase cell-type (clustering) resolution in the latent space. When assessing the predictive power across data modalities, LIBRA outperforms existing tools. Finally, considering the importance of hyperparameters, we implemented an adaptative-tuning strategy, labelled aLIBRA, in the LIBRA package. As expected, adaptive parameter optimization significantly boosts the performance of learning predictive models from paired datasets. Additionally, aLIBRA provides parameter combinations balancing the integrative and predictive tasks. Conclusions LIBRA is a versatile tool, uniquely targeting both integration and prediction tasks of Single-cell multi-omics data. LIBRA is a data-driven robust platform that includes an adaptive learning scheme. Furthermore, LIBRA is freely available as R and Python libraries (https://github.com/TranslationalBioinformaticsUnit/LIBRA).

The most current clustering methods are designed for one data type only, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) or sc-methylation data alone, and a few are developed for the integrative analysis of multiple data types. The integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell genomic data sets leverages the power in multiple data sets and can deepen the biological insight. In this paper, we propose a coupled co-clustering-based unsupervised transfer learning algorithm (coupleCoC) for the integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell data. Our proposed coupleCoC builds upon the information theoretic co-clustering framework. In co-clustering, both the cells and the genomic features are simultaneously clustered. Clustering similar genomic features reduces the noise in single-cell data and facilitates transfer of knowledge across single-cell datasets. We applied coupleCoC for the integrative analysis of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data, sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data and scRNA-seq data from mouse and human. We demonstrate that coupleCoC improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic datasets. Our method coupleCoC is also computationally efficient and can scale up to large datasets. Availability: The software and datasets are available at https://github.com/cuhklinlab/coupleCoC.

This task is challenging due to the lack of a shared axis across datasets obtained from different types of single-cell experiments. For most such datasets, we lack corresponding information among the cells (samples) and the measurements (features). In this scenario, unsupervised algorithms that are capable of aligning single-cell experiments are critical to learning an in silico co-assay that can help draw correspondences among the cells. Maximum mean discrepancy-based manifold alignment (MMD-MA) is such an unsupervised algorithm. Without requiring correspondence information, it can align single-cell datasets from different modalities in a common shared latent space, showing promising results on simulations and a small-scale single-cell experiment with 61 cells. However, it is essential to explore the applicability of this method to larger single-cell experiments with thousands of cells so that it can be of practical interest to the community. In this paper, we apply MMD-MA to two recent datasets that measure transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in ~2000 single cells. To scale the runtime of MMD-MA to a more substantial number of cells, we extend the original implementation to run on GPUs. We also introduce a method to automatically select one of the user-defined parameters, thus reducing the hyperparameter search space. We demonstrate that the proposed extensions allow MMD-MA to accurately align state-of-the-art single-cell experiments.	matplotlib, torch	JLMA, UnionCom, PCA, Random Projection	Unsupervised manifold alignment for single-cell multi-omics data	4.721147653	3.909562717	5.904017382	10.1101/2020.06.13.149195	2	Singh R, Demetci P, Bonora G, Ramani V, Lee C, Fang H, Duan Z, Deng X, Shendure J, Disteche C, Noble WS.

These networks reconfigure during dynamic processes such as cell fate specification to drive diverse cellular states. Single-cell transcriptomic technologies, such as single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq), can examine the transcriptional state of individual cells, allowing the study of cell-type specific gene regulation at unprecedented detail. However, current approaches to infer cell type-specific gene regulatory networks from these datasets are limited in their ability to integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq measurements and to model network dynamics on a cell lineage. To address this challenge, we have developed single-cell Multi-Task Network Inference (scMTNI), a multi-task learning framework to infer the gene regulatory network for each cell type on a lineage from scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. Using simulated, published and newly collected single cell omic datasets, we show that scMTNI is able to accurately infer gene regulatory networks and captures meaningful network dynamics that identify GRN components associated with cell type transitions. Application of our method to mouse cellular reprogramming identified key regulators associated with cell populations that reprogram versus those that are stalled. Taken together, scMTNI is a powerful framework to infer cell type-specific gene regulatory networks and their dynamics from scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets.	cassert, chrono, utility, vector	MRTLE, GNAT, Ontogenet, AMuSR, LASSO regression, INDEP, SCENIC	Inference of cell type-specific gene regulatory networks on cell lineages from single cell omic datasets	29.20423385	15.97925351	11.63940981	10.1101/2022.07.25.501350	5	Zhang S, Pyne S, Pietrzak S, Siahpirani AF, Sridharan R, Roy S.

These datasets, including scRNA-seq data, scATAC-seq data and sc-methylation data, usually have different powers in identifying the unknown cell types through clustering. So, methods that integrate multiple datasets can potentially lead to a better clustering performance. Here we propose coupleCoC+ for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data. coupleCoC+ is a transfer learning method based on the information-theoretic co-clustering framework. In coupleCoC+, we utilize the information in one dataset, the source data, to facilitate the analysis of another dataset, the target data. coupleCoC+ uses the linked features in the two datasets for effective knowledge transfer, and it also uses the information of the features in the target data that are unlinked with the source data. In addition, coupleCoC+ matches similar cell types across the source data and the target data. By applying coupleCoC+ to the integrative clustering of mouse cortex scATAC-seq data and scRNA-seq data, mouse and human scRNA-seq data, mouse cortex sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data, and human blood dendritic cells scRNA-seq data from two batches, we demonstrate that coupleCoC+ improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic datasets. coupleCoC+ has fast convergence and it is computationally efficient. The software is available at https://github.com/cuhklinlab/coupleCoC_plus.

Sequencing of one molecular type (RNA, methylated DNA or open chromatin) in a single cell, furthermore, provides insights into the cell's phenotype and links to its genotype. Nevertheless, only by taking measurements of these phenotypes and genotypes from the same single cells can such inferences be made unambiguously. In this review, we survey the first experimental approaches that assay, in parallel, multiple molecular types from the same single cell, before considering the challenges and opportunities afforded by these and future technologies.

A key challenge in realizing this potential is integrating single-cell datasets from multiple protocols, biological contexts, and data modalities into a joint definition of cellular identity. We previously developed an approach, called linked inference of genomic experimental relationships (LIGER), that uses integrative nonnegative matrix factorization to address this challenge. Here, we provide a step-by-step protocol for using LIGER to jointly define cell types from multiple single-cell datasets. The main stages of the protocol are data preprocessing and normalization, joint factorization, quantile normalization and joint clustering, and visualization. We describe how to jointly define cell types from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) data, but similar steps apply across a wide range of other settings and data types, including cross-species analysis, single-nucleus DNA methylation, and spatial transcriptomics. Our protocol contains examples of expected results, describes common pitfalls, and relies only on our freely available, open-source R implementation of LIGER. We also provide R Markdown tutorials showing the outputs from each individual code segment. The analysis process can be performed in 1–4 h, depending on dataset size, and assumes no specialized bioinformatics training.

Therefore, understanding the genotype-to-phenotype axis requires a comprehensive catalog of functional non-coding genomic elements, most of which are involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Genome-wide maps of open chromatin regions can facilitate functional analysis of cis- and trans-regulatory elements via their connections with trait-associated sequence variants. Currently, Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) is considered the most accessible and cost-effective strategy for genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) technology has also been developed to study cell type-specific chromatin accessibility in tissue samples containing a heterogeneous cellular population. However, due to the intrinsic nature of scATAC-seq data, which are highly noisy and sparse, accurate extraction of biological signals and devising effective biological hypothesis are difficult. To overcome such limitations in scATAC-seq data analysis, new methods and software tools have been developed over the past few years. Nevertheless, there is no consensus for the best practice of scATAC-seq data analysis yet. In this review, we discuss scATAC-seq technology and data analysis methods, ranging from preprocessing to downstream analysis, along with an up-to-date list of published studies that involved the application of this method. We expect this review will provide a guideline for successful data generation and analysis methods using appropriate software tools and databases for the study of chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution.

Most of the existing methods for single cell atlas analysis use cells as the reference unit to combine datasets. However, such methods suffer from the limitations of inability to effectively integrate cross-modality data, hindering downstream gene-based analysis, and loss of genuine biological variations. Here we present a new data integration method, GIANT, which is for the first time designed for the atlas-scale analysis from the gene perspective. GIANT first converts datasets from different modalities into gene graphs, and then recursively embeds genes in the graphs into a latent space without additional alignment. Applying GIANT to the HuBMAP datasets creates a unified gene embedding space across multiple human tissues and data modalities, where gene representations reflect the functions of genes in their cells. Further evaluations demonstrate the usefulness of GIANT in discovering diverse gene functions, and underlying gene regulations in cells of different tissues.	anndata, cython, goatools, joblib, leidenalg, matplotlib, networkx, pyensembl, scanpy	None	A unified analysis of atlas single cell data	47.41804544	59.39654631	29.28716744	10.1101/2022.08.06.503038	60	Chen H, Nguyen ND, Ruffalo M, Bar-Joseph Z.

The problem of scATAC-seq is data sparsity and most of the genomic sites are inaccessible. Here, tensor decomposition (TD) was used to fill in missing values. In this study, TD was applied to massive scATAC-seq data and generated averaging within 200 bp intervals, and this number can reach 13,627,618. Currently, no other methods can deal with large sparse matrices. The proposed method could not only provide UMAP embedding that coincides with tissue specificity, but also select genes associated with various biological enrichment terms and transcription factor targeting. This suggests that TD is a useful tool to process large sparse matrix generated from scATAC-seq.

Genetic variation can be attributed to the downstream effects of inherited mutations, environmental factors, or inaccurately resolved errors in transcription and replication. When lesions occur in regions that confer a proliferative advantage, it can support clonal expansion, subclonal variation, and neoplastic progression. In this manner, the complex heterogeneous microenvironment of a tumour promotes the likelihood of angiogenesis and metastasis. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and computational biology have utilized single-cell applications to build deep profiles of individual cells that are otherwise masked in bulk profiling. In addition, the development of new techniques for combining single-cell multi-omic strategies is providing a more precise understanding of factors contributing to cellular identity, function, and growth. Continuing advancements in single-cell technology and computational deconvolution of data will be critical for reconstructing patient specific intra-tumour features and developing more personalized cancer treatments.

Recent surveys of mouse and human brains with single-cell transcriptomics2,3,4,5,6 and high-throughput imaging technologies7,8 have uncovered hundreds of neural cell types distributed in different brain regions, but the transcriptional regulatory programs that are responsible for the unique identity and function of each cell type remain unknown. Here we probe the accessible chromatin in more than 800,000 individual nuclei from 45 regions that span the adult mouse isocortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebral nuclei, and use the resulting data to map the state of 491,818 candidate cis-regulatory DNA elements in 160 distinct cell types. We find high specificity of spatial distribution for not only excitatory neurons, but also most classes of inhibitory neurons and a subset of glial cell types. We characterize the gene regulatory sequences associated with the regional specificity within these cell types. We further link a considerable fraction of the cis-regulatory elements to putative target genes expressed in diverse cerebral cell types and predict transcriptional regulators that are involved in a broad spectrum of molecular and cellular pathways in different neuronal and glial cell populations. Our results provide a foundation for comprehensive analysis of gene regulatory programs of the mammalian brain and assist in the interpretation of noncoding risk variants associated with various neurological diseases and traits in humans.

We propose scMoMaT, a method that is able to integrate single cell multi-omics data under the mosaic integration scenario using matrix tri-factorization. During integration, scMoMaT is also able to uncover the cluster specific bio-markers across modalities. These multi-modal bio-markers are used to interpret and annotate the clusters to cell types. Moreover, scMoMaT can integrate cell batches with unequal cell type compositions. Applying scMoMaT to multiple real and simulated datasets demonstrated these features of scMoMaT and showed that scMoMaT has superior performance compared to existing methods. We also show that integrated cell embedding combined with learned bio-markers leads to cell type annotations of higher quality or resolution compared to their original annotations.	adjustText, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, torch, umap	UNINMF, MultiMap	scMoMaT: Mosaic integration of single cell multi-omics data using matrix trifactorization	12.25736713	10.12919623	7.026013896	10.1101/2022.05.17.492336	5	Zhang Z, Sun H, Chen X, Mariappan R, Chen X, Jain M, Efremova M, Rajan V, Teichmann S, Zhang X. scMoMaT: Mosaic integration of single cell multi-omics matrices using matrix trifactorization. bioRxiv. 2022 Jan 1.

Above all, single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing (scATAC-seq) is a popular approach of analyzing chromatin accessibility differences at the level of single cell, either within or between groups. As a result, it is critical to examine cell heterogeneity at a previously unseen level and to identify both recognized and unknown cell types. However, with the ever-increasing number of cells engendered by technological development and the characteristics of the data, such as high noise, sparsity and dimension, challenges in distinguishing cell types have emerged. We propose scVAEBGM, which integrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Bayesian Gaussian-mixture model (BGM) to process and analyze scATAC-seq data. This method combines and takes benefits of a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model to estimate the number of cell types without determining the cluster number in a beforehand. In other words, the size of the clusters is inferred from the data, thus avoiding biases introduced by subjective assessments when manually determining the size of the clusters. Additionally, the method is more robust to noise and can better represent single-cell data in lower dimensions. We also create a further clustering strategy. It is indicated by experiments that further clustering based on the already completed clustering can improve the clustering accuracy again. We test on six public datasets, and scVAEBGM outperforms various dimension reduction baselines. In downstream applications, scVAEBGM can reveal biological cell types.

Herein we present Scarf, a modularly designed Python package that seamlessly interoperates with other single-cell toolkits and allows for memory-efficient single-cell analysis of millions of cells on a laptop or low-cost devices like single-board computers. We demonstrate Scarf’s memory and compute-time efficiency by applying it to the largest existing single-cell RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq datasets. Scarf wraps memory-efficient implementations of a graph-based t-stochastic neighbour embedding and hierarchical clustering algorithm. Moreover, Scarf performs accurate reference-anchored mapping of datasets while maintaining memory efficiency. By implementing a subsampling algorithm, Scarf additionally has the capacity to generate representative sampling of cells from a given dataset wherein rare cell populations and lineage differentiation trajectories are conserved. Together, Scarf provides a framework wherein any researcher can perform advanced processing, subsampling, reanalysis, and integration of atlas-scale datasets on standard laptop computers.

Single-cell RNA sequencing technologies have provided a transformative view of cell-type-specific gene expression, the output of cell-type-specific gene regulatory programs. This review discusses new single-cell genomic technologies that complement single-cell RNA sequencing by providing additional readouts of cellular state beyond the transcriptome. We highlight regression models as a simple yet powerful approach to relate gene expression to other aspects of cellular state, and in doing so, gain insights into the biochemical mechanisms that are necessary to produce a given gene expression output.

In comparison to current techniques that are only capable of characterizing average epigenomic features across bulk cell ensembles, single-cell epigenomic methodologies are emerging as powerful new techniques to study cellular plasticity and heterogeneity, as seen in stem cells and cancer. Here we summarize available techniques for studies of single-cell epigenomics, review their current applications to cancer research, and discuss future possibilities.

However, most single-cell analyses neglect the nested structures while detecting and visualizing the functional diversity. Here, we incorporate cell hierarchy to study functional diversity at subpopulation, club (i.e., sub-subpopulation), and cell layers. Accordingly, we implement a package, SEAT, to construct cell hierarchies utilizing structure entropy by minimizing the global uncertainty in cell-cell graphs. With cell hierarchies, SEAT deciphers functional diversity in 36 datasets covering scRNA, scDNA, scATAC, and scRNA-scATAC multiome. First, SEAT finds optimal cell subpopulations with high clustering accuracy. It identifies cell types or fates from omics profiles and boosts accuracy from 0.34 to 1. Second, SEAT detects insightful functional diversity among cell clubs. The hierarchy of breast cancer cells reveals that the specific tumor cell club drives AREG-EGFT signaling. We identify a dense co-accessibility network of cis-regulatory elements specified by one cell club in GM12878. Third, the cell order from the hierarchy infers periodic pseudo-time of cells, improving accuracy from 0.79 to 0.89. Moreover, we incorporate cell hierarchy layers as prior knowledge to refine nonlinear dimension reduction, enabling us to visualize hierarchical cell layouts in low-dimensional space.	heapq, kmeas1d, matplotlib, networkx, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, seaborn	hierarchical clustering, K-means, spectral clustering, Louvain, Leiden	Incorporating cell hierarchy to decipher the functional diversity of single cells	11.75345474	8.321322473	8.064681728	10.1101/2022.08.17.504240	3	Chen L, Li S.

Here we present a new method for the inference of eGRNs, called SCENIC+. SCENIC+ predicts genomic enhancers along with candidate upstream transcription factors (TF) and links these enhancers to candidate target genes. Specific TFs for each cell type or cell state are predicted based on the concordance of TF binding site accessibility, TF expression, and target gene expression. To improve both recall and precision of TF identification, we curated and clustered more than 40,000 position weight matrices that we could associate with 1,553 human TFs. We validated and benchmarked each of the SCENIC+ components on diverse data sets from different species, including human peripheral blood mononuclear cell types, ENCODE cell lines, human melanoma cell states, and Drosophila retinal development. Next, we exploit SCENIC+ predictions to study conserved TFs, enhancers, and GRNs between human and mouse cell types in the cerebral cortex. Finally, we provide new capabilities that exploit the inferred eGRNs to study the dynamics of gene regulation along differentiation trajectories; to map regulatory activities onto tissues using spatial omics data; and to predict the effect of TF perturbations on cell state. SCENIC+ provides critical insight into gene regulation, starting from multiome atlases of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq.

Supervised celltyping methods have gained increasing popularity in single-cell RNA-seq data because of the superior performance and the availability of high-quality reference datasets. Recent technological advances in profiling chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution (scATAC-seq) have brought new insights to the understanding of epigenetic heterogeneity. With continuous accumulation of scATAC-seq datasets, supervised celltyping method specifically designed for scATAC-seq is in urgent need. In this work, we develop Cellcano, a novel computational method based on a two-round supervised learning algorithm to identify cell types from scATAC-seq data. The method alleviates the distributional shift between reference and target data and improves the prediction performance. We systematically benchmark Cellcano on 50 well-designed experiments from various datasets and show that Cellcano is accurate, robust, and computational efficient.

The captured data can be represented by tensors, i.e., the higher-rank matrices. However, the proposed analysis tools often take the data as a collection of two-order matrices, renouncing the correspondences among the features. Consequently, we propose a probabilistic tensor decomposition framework, SCOIT, to extract embeddings from single-cell multiomic data. To deal with sparse, noisy, and heterogeneous single-cell data, we incorporate various distributions in SCOIT, including Gaussian, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions. Our framework can decompose a multiomic tensor into a cell embedding matrix, a gene embedding matrix, and an omic embedding matrix, allowing for various downstream analyses. We applied SCOIT to seven single-cell multiomic datasets from different sequencing protocols. With cell embeddings, SCOIT achieves superior performance for cell clustering compared to seven state-of-the-art tools under various metrics, demonstrating its ability to dissect cellular heterogeneity. With the gene embeddings, SCOIT enables cross-omics gene expression analysis and integrative gene regulatory network study. Furthermore, the embeddings allow cross-omics imputation simultaneously, outperforming conventional imputation methods with the Pearson correlation coefficient increased by 0.03-0.28.	numpy, torch	PCA, tSNE, Seurat, scAI, totalVI, UnionCom, Matcher	Probabilistic tensor decomposition extracts better latent embeddings from single-cell multiomic data	15.37669248	10.51231471	10.27107105	10.1101/2022.08.26.505382	5	Ruohan WA, Jianping WA, Li S.

Yet, despite its complexity, gene regulatory logic can be broken down into modular components consisting of a transcription factor (TF) activating or repressing the target gene expression through its binding to a cis-regulatory region. We propose a nonparametric approach, TRIPOD, to detect and characterize the three-way relationships between a TF, its target gene, and the accessibility of the TF’s binding site using single-cell RNA and ATAC multiomic data. We apply TRIPOD to interrogate the cell-type-specific regulatory logic in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and contrast our results to detections from enhancer databases, cis-eQTL studies, ChIP-seq experiments, and TF knockdown/knockout studies. We then apply TRIPOD to mouse embryonic brain data and identify regulatory relationships, validated by ChIP-seq and PLAC-seq. Finally, we demonstrate TRIPOD on the SHARE-seq data of differentiating mouse hair follicle cells and identify lineage-specific regulation supported by histone marks and super-enhancer annotations.

Substantial advances of this work include the optimization of a single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for transposase accessible chromatin (sci-ATAC-seq); a software suite, scitools, for the rapid processing and visualization of single-cell combinatorial indexing data sets; and a valuable resource of hippocampal regulatory networks at single-cell resolution. We used sci-ATAC-seq to produce 2346 high-quality single-cell chromatin accessibility maps with a mean unique read count per cell of 29,201 from both fresh and frozen hippocampi, observing little difference in accessibility patterns between the preparations. By using this data set, we identified eight distinct major clusters of cells representing both neuronal and nonneuronal cell types and characterized the driving regulatory factors and differentially accessible loci that define each cluster. Within pyramidal neurons, we identified four major clusters, including CA1 and CA3 neurons, and three additional subclusters. We then applied a recently described coaccessibility framework, Cicero, which identified 146,818 links between promoters and putative distal regulatory DNA. Identified coaccessibility networks showed cell-type specificity, shedding light on key dynamic loci that reconfigure to specify hippocampal cell lineages. Lastly, we performed an additional sci-ATAC-seq preparation from cultured hippocampal neurons (899 high-quality cells, 43,532 mean unique reads) that revealed substantial alterations in their epigenetic landscape compared with nuclei from hippocampal tissue. This data set and accompanying analysis tools provide a new resource that can guide subsequent studies of the hippocampus.

In order to address this problem, we present Semi-Supervised Identification of Populations of cells in scATAC-seq data (SSIPs), a semi-supervised approach that integrates bulk and single-cell data through a generalizable network model featuring two types of nodes. Nodes of the first type represent cells from scATAC-seq with edges between them encoding information about cell similarity. A second set of nodes represents “supervising” datasets connected to cell nodes with edges that encode the similarity between that data and each cell. Via global calculations of network influence, this model allows us to quantify the influence of bulk data on scATAC-seq data and estimate the contributions of scATAC-seq cell populations to signals in bulk data. Using simulated data, we show that SSIPs successfully separates distinct cell types even when they differ in very few mapped scATAC-seq reads, with a significant improvement over unsupervised cell type identification. We apply SSIPs to scATAC-seq data from the developing human brain and show that supervising with just 25 differentially expressed genes from scRNA-seq enables the identification of two subtypes of interneurons not identifiable from scATAC-seq data alone. SSIPs opens the door to identifying high resolution cell types in single-cell open chromatin data, enabling the study of cell-type specific regulatory elements.

While processing of other types of single cell data was boosted by the implementation of alignment-free techniques, pipelines available to process scATAC-seq data still require large computational resources. We propose here an approach based on pseudoalignment, which reduces the execution times and hardware needs at little cost for precision. Methods: Public data for 10k PBMC were downloaded from 10x Genomics web site. Reads were aligned to various references derived from DNase I Hypersensitive Sites (DHS) using kallisto and quantified with bustools. We compared our results with the ones publicly available derived by cellranger-atac. We subsequently tested our approach on scATAC-seq data for K562 cell line. Results: We found that kallisto does not introduce biases in quantification of known peaks; cells groups identified are consistent with the ones identified from standard method. We also found that cell identification is robust when analysis is performed using DHS-derived reference in place of de novo identification of ATAC peaks. Lastly, we found that our approach is suitable for reliable quantification of gene activity based on scATAC-seq signal, thus allows for efficient labelling of cell groups based on marker genes. Conclusions: Analysis of scATAC-seq data by means of kallisto produces results in line with standard pipelines while being considerably faster; using a set of known DHS sites as reference does not affect the ability to characterize the cell populations.

On scDNA-seq data from gastric, colorectal and breast cancer samples, with validation using matched linked-read sequencing, Alleloscope finds pervasive occurrence of highly complex, multiallelic CNAs, in which cells that carry varying allelic configurations adding to the same total copy number coevolve within a tumor. On scATAC-seq from two basal cell carcinoma samples and a gastric cancer cell line, Alleloscope detected multiallelic copy number events and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity, enabling dissection of the contributions of chromosomal instability and chromatin remodeling to tumor evolution.

The data structure and feature in scRNA-seq is similar to that in scATAC-seq, therefore, it’s encouraged to identify and classify the cell types in scATAC-seq through traditional supervised machine learning methods, which are proved reliable in scRNA-seq datasets. Results: In this study, we evaluated the classification performance of 6 well-known machine learning methods on scATAC-seq. A total of 4 public scATAC-seq datasets vary in tissues, sizes and technologies were applied to the evaluation of the performance of the methods. We assessed these methods using a 5-folds cross validation experiment, called intra-dataset experiment, based on recall, precision and the percentage of correctly predicted cells. The results show that these methods performed well in some specific types of the cell in a specific scATAC-seq dataset, while the overall performance is not as well as that in scRNA-seq analysis. In addition, we evaluated the classification performance of these methods by training and predicting in different datasets generated from same sample, called inter-datasets experiments, which may help us to assess the performance of these methods in more realistic scenarios. Conclusions: Both in intra-dataset and in inter-dataset experiment, SVM and NMC are overall outperformed others across all 4 datasets. Thus, we recommend researchers to use SVM and NMC as the underlying classifier when developing an automatic cell-type classification method for scATAC-seq.

The recently developed low-input and single-cell regulome mapping technologies such as ATAC-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) allow analyses of small-cell-number and single-cell samples, but their signals remain highly discrete or noisy. Compared to these regulome mapping technologies, transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq is more widely used. Transcriptome data in single-cell and small-cell-number samples are more continuous and often less noisy. Here, we show that one can globally predict chromatin accessibility and infer regulatory element activities using RNA-seq. Genome-wide chromatin accessibility predicted by RNA-seq from 30 cells can offer better accuracy than ATAC-seq from 500 cells. Predictions based on single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can more accurately reconstruct bulk chromatin accessibility than using scATAC-seq. Integrating ATAC-seq with predictions from RNA-seq increases the power and value of both methods. Thus, transcriptome-based prediction provides a new tool for decoding gene regulatory circuitry in samples with limited cell numbers.

At the same time, cell type annotation is critical in understanding the cellular composition of complex tissues and identifying potential novel cell types. However, most existing methods that can perform automated cell type annotation are designed to transfer labels from an annotated scRNA-seq data set to another scRNA-seq data set, and it is not clear whether these methods are adaptable to annotate scATAC-seq data. Several methods have been recently proposed for label transfer from scRNA-seq data to scATAC-seq data, but there is a lack of benchmarking study on the performance of these methods. Here, we evaluated the performance of five scATAC-seq annotation methods on both their classification accuracy and scalability using publicly available single-cell datasets from mouse and human tissues including brain, lung, kidney, PBMC and BMMC. Using the BMMC data as basis, we further investigated the performance of these methods across different data sizes, mislabeling rates, sequencing depths and the number of cell types unique to scATAC-seq. Bridge integration, which is the only method that requires additional multimodal data and does not need gene activity calculation, was overall the best method and robust to changes in data size, mislabeling rate and sequencing depth. Conos was the most time and memory efficient method but performed the worst in terms of prediction accuracy. scJoint tended to assign cells to similar cell types and performed relatively poorly for complex datasets with deep annotations but performed better for datasets only with major label annotations. The performance of scGCN and Seurat v3 was moderate, but scGCN was the most time-consuming method and had the most similar performance to random classifiers for cell types unique to scATAC-seq.

Of particular interest are interactions in which a given TF regulates other TFs; these interactions define the TF regulatory networks (TRNs) that underlie cellular identity and major function. Chromatin accessibility depicts whether or not a DNA sequence is physically accessible and provides a direct measurement of transcriptional regulation. Benefiting from the accumulating chromatin accessibility data and deep learning advances, we developed a new computational method named DeepTFni to infer TRNs from the single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) data. By implementing a graph neural network, which is more suitable for network representation, DeepTFni shows outstanding performance in TRN inference, which it supports with limited numbers of cells. Furthermore, by applying DeepTFni we identified hub TFs in tissue development and tumorigenesis and revealed that many mixed-phenotype acute leukemia associated genes undergo a prominent alteration to the TRN while there is moderate difference in messenger RNA level. The DeepTFni webserver is easy to use and has provided the predicted TRNs for several popular cell lines.

However, to date, the existing computational approaches for integration of multimodal single cell data are either computationally expensive, require the delineation of parameters or can only be applied to particular modalities. We present a single cell multi-modal integration method, named MOJITOO (Multi-mOdal Joint IntegraTion of cOmpOnents). MOJITOO uses canonical correlation analysis for a fast and parameter free detection of a shared representation of cells from multimodal single cell data. Moreover, estimated canonical components can be used for interpretation, i.e. association of modality specific molecular features with the latent space. We evaluate MOJITOO using bi- and tri-modal single cell data sets and show that MOJITOO outperforms existing methods regarding computational requirements, preservation of original latent spaces and clustering.

This task can be challenging as it requires joint modeling of context-specific activation of cis-regulatory elements (REs) and the effects on transcription of associated regulatory factors. To meet this challenge, we propose a statistical approach based on paired expression and chromatin accessibility (PECA) data across diverse cellular contexts. In our approach, we model (i) the localization to REs of chromatin regulators (CRs) based on their interaction with sequence-specific TFs, (ii) the activation of REs due to CRs that are localized to them, and (iii) the effect of TFs bound to activated REs on the transcription of target genes (TGs). The transcriptional regulatory network inferred by PECA provides a detailed view of how trans- and cis-regulatory elements work together to affect gene expression in a context-specific manner. We illustrate the feasibility of this approach by analyzing paired expression and accessibility data from the mouse Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and explore various applications of the resulting model.

Starting with transcriptome analyses, single-cell techniques have extended to multi-omics approaches and now enable the simultaneous measurement of data modalities and spatial cellular context. Data are now available for millions of cells, for whole-genome measurements and for multiple modalities. Although analyses of such multimodal datasets have the potential to provide new insights into biological processes that cannot be inferred with a single mode of assay, the integration of very large, complex, multimodal data into biological models and mechanisms represents a considerable challenge. An understanding of the principles of data integration and visualization methods is required to determine what methods are best applied to a particular single-cell dataset. Each class of method has advantages and pitfalls in terms of its ability to achieve various biological goals, including cell-type classification, regulatory network modelling and biological process inference. In choosing a data integration strategy, consideration must be given to whether the multi-omics data are matched (that is, measured on the same cell) or unmatched (that is, measured on different cells) and, more importantly, the overall modelling and visualization goals of the integrated analysis.

Recently, an increasing number of computational methods have been developed to address various computational problems with single-cell data, including cell clustering, trajectory inference, integration of data from multiple batches and modalities, inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and cell-cell interactions. Simulators that are designed to test a certain computational problem model only the particular factors that affect the output data; whereas modelling as many biological factors as possible into the simulation allows the generated data to have realistic complexity and can be used to benchmark a wider range of computational methods. Here, we present scMultiSim, an in silico simulator that generates multi-modality data of single-cells, including gene expression, chromatin accessibility, RNA velocity, and spatial cell locations while accounting for the relationships between modalities. We proposed a unified framework to jointly model biological factors including cell-cell interactions, with-in-cell GRNs and chromatin accessibility, so all their effects simultaneously present in the output data. Users enjoy unprecedented flexibility by having full control of the cell population and the ability to fine-tune each factor’s effect on the underlying model. We also provide options to simulate technical variations including batch effects to make the output resemble real data. We verified the simulated biological effects and demonstrated scMultiSim’s applications by benchmarking four computational tasks on single-cell multi-omics data: GRN inference, RNA velocity estimation, integration of single-cell datasets from multiple batches and modalities, and analysis of cell-cell interaction using the cell spatial location data. To our knowledge, scMultiSim is the only simulator of single cell data that can perform benchmarking for all these four challenging computational tasks.

Advancing tools to integrate multi-omics data, we develop functional inference of gene regulation (FigR), a framework to computationally pair scATAC-seq with scRNA-seq cells, connect distal cis-regulatory elements to genes, and infer gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) to identify candidate transcription factor (TF) regulators. Utilizing these paired multi-omics data, we define domains of regulatory chromatin (DORCs) of immune stimulation and find that cells alter chromatin accessibility and gene expression at timescales of minutes. Construction of the stimulation GRN elucidates TF activity at disease-associated DORCs. Overall, FigR enables elucidation of regulatory interactions across single-cell data, providing new opportunities to understand the function of cells within tissues.	chromVAR, motifmatchr	None	Functional inference of gene regulation using single-cell multi-omics	23.40790511	13.73042427	5.971246008	None	1	Kartha VK, Duarte FM, Hu Y, Ma S, Chew JG, Lareau CA, Earl A, Burkett ZD, Kohlway AS, Lebofsky R, Buenrostro JD.

Each cell in the multi-omic dataset comprises an element in a ‘dictionary’, which can be used to reconstruct unimodal datasets and transform them into a shared space. We demonstrate that our procedure can accurately harmonize transcriptomic data with independent single cell measurements of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, and protein levels.

Different single-cell assays show extensive variation in sensitivity and signal to noise levels. In particular, scATAC-seq generates extremely sparse and noisy datasets. Existing methods developed to analyze this data require cells amenable to pseudo-time analysis or require datasets with drastically different cell-types. We describe a novel approach using self-organizing maps (SOM) to link scATAC-seq regions with scRNA-seq genes that overcomes these challenges and can generate draft regulatory networks. Our SOMatic package generates chromatin and gene expression SOMs separately and combines them using a linking function. We applied SOMatic on a mouse pre-B cell differentiation time-course using controlled Ikaros over-expression to recover gene ontology enrichments, identify motifs in genomic regions showing similar single-cell profiles, and generate a gene regulatory network that both recovers known interactions and predicts new Ikaros targets during the differentiation process. The ability of linked SOMs to detect emergent properties from multiple types of highly-dimensional genomic data with very different signal properties opens new avenues for integrative analysis of heterogeneous data.

The advancement of bulk and single-cell sequencing technologies and related computational methods for multi-omics largely facilitated the development of system biology and precision medicine. Single-cell approaches have the advantage of dissecting cellular dynamics and heterogeneity, whereas traditional bulk technologies are limited to individual/population-level investigation. In this review, we first summarize the technologies for producing bulk and single-cell multi-omics data. Then, we survey the computational approaches for integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell multimodal data, respectively.

Recently, bulk multiomics analyses, such as multidimensional genomic and proteogenomic analyses, have proven beneficial for obtaining a comprehensive understanding of cellular events. This benefit has facilitated the development of single-cell multiomics analysis, which enables cell type-specific gene regulation to be examined. The cardinal features of single-cell multiomics analysis include (1) technologies for single-cell isolation, barcoding, and sequencing to measure multiple types of molecules from individual cells and (2) the integrative analysis of molecules to characterize cell types and their functions regarding pathophysiological processes based on molecular signatures.

Understanding ATAC-seq data presents distinct analysis challenges, compared to RNA-seq technologies, because of the relative sparseness of the data produced and the interaction of complex noise with multiple chromatin structure scales. Methods commonly used to analyze chromatin accessibility datasets are adapted from algorithms designed to process different experimental technologies, disregarding the statistical and biological differences intrinsic to the ATAC-seq technology. Here, we present a Bayesian statistical approach, termed ChromA, to analyze ATAC-seq data. ChromA annotates the cellular epigenetic landscape by integrating information from replicates, producing a consensus de-noised annotation of chromatin accessibility. Our method can analyze single cell ATAC-seq data, improving cell type identification and correcting many of the biases generated by the sparse sampling inherent in single cell technologies. We validate ChromA on several biological systems, including mouse and human immune cells and find it effective at recovering accessible chromatin, establishing ChromA as a top preforming general platform for mapping the chromatin landscape in different cellular populations from diverse experimental designs.	psutil, pysam	PD, M2	Characterizing the epigenetic landscape of cellular populations from bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq information	39.32557222	18.51215995	7.271239404	10.1101/567669	1	Gabitto MI, Rasmussen A, Wapinski O, Allaway K, Carriero N, Fishell GJ, Bonneau R.

Recently implemented multi– omics measurements of genomes, transcriptomes, epigenomes, proteomes and chromatin organization are opening up new avenues to begin to disentangle the causal relationship between -omics layers and how these co-determine higherorder cellular phenotypes. This technological revolution is not restricted to basic science but promises major breakthroughs in medical diagnostics and treatments.

Here, we introduce UniPath, for representing single-cells using pathway and gene-set enrichment scores by a transformation of their open-chromatin or gene-expression profiles. The robust statistical approach of UniPath provides high accuracy, consistency and scalability in estimating gene-set enrichment scores for every cell. Its framework provides an easy solution for handling variability in drop-out rate, which can sometimes create artefact due to systematic patterns. UniPath provides an alternative approach of dimension reduction of single-cell open-chromatin profiles. UniPath's approach of predicting temporal-order of single-cells using their pathway enrichment scores enables suppression of covariates to achieve correct order of cells. Analysis of mouse cell atlas using our approach yielded surprising, albeit biologically-meaningful co-clustering of cell-types from distant organs. By enabling an unconventional method of exploiting pathway co-occurrence to compare two groups of cells, our approach also proves to be useful in inferring context-specific regulations in cancer cells.

This variability has important functional implications for tissue biology and disease states such as cancer. Mapping of epigenomic information such as chromatin accessibility, nucleosome positioning, histone tail modifications and enhancer–promoter interactions in both bulk-cell and single-cell samples has shown that these characteristics of chromatin state contribute to expression or repression of associated genes. Advances in single-cell epigenomic profiling methods are enabling high-resolution mapping of chromatin states in individual cells. Recent studies using these techniques provide evidence that variations in different aspects of chromatin organization collectively define gene expression heterogeneity among otherwise highly similar cells.

However, the highly different features on sparsity, heterogeneity and dimensionality between multi-omics data have severely hindered its integrative analysis. Results: We proposed deep cross-omics cycle attention (DCCA) model, a computational tool for joint analysis of single-cell multi-omics data, by combining variational autoencoders (VAEs) and attention-transfer. Specifically, we show that DCCA can leverage one omics data to fine-tune the network trained for another omics data, given a dataset of parallel multi-omics data within the same cell. Studies on both simulated and real datasets from various platforms, DCCA demonstrates its superior capability: (i) dissecting cellular heterogeneity; (ii) denoising and aggregating data and (iii) constructing the link between multi-omics data, which is used to infer new transcriptional regulatory relations. In our applications, DCCA was demonstrated to have a superior power to generate missing stages or omics in a biologically meaningful manner, which provides a new way to analyze and also understand complicated biological processes.

Polarbear	Python	4	cross-omics translation	cross-omics translation (scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq)	A semi-supervised approach that learns to translate between single-cell modalities by leveraging both single-assay and co-assay data.	10.1007/978-3-031-04749-7_2	RECOMB 2022	Published	https://github.com/Noble-Lab/Polarbear	2022.11.22	2022.11.22	2022.04.29	variational autoencoder	CAS	2022.04.29	None	0		2	3	The emergence of single-cell co-assays enables us to learn to translate between single-cell modalities, potentially offering valuable insights from datasets where only one modality is available. However, the sparsity of single-cell measurements and the limited number of cells measured in typical co-assay datasets impedes the power of cross-modality translation. Here, we propose Polarbear, a semi-supervised translation framework to predict cross-modality profiles that is trained using a combination of co-assay data and traditional “single-assay” data. Polarbear uses single-assay and co-assay data to train an autoencoder for each modality and then uses just the co-assay data to train a translator between the embedded representations learned by the autoencoders. With this approach, Polarbear is able to translate between modalities with improved accuracy relative to state-of-the-art translation techniques.

Here we present MIRA, probabilistic multimodal models for integrated regulatory analysis, a comprehensive methodology that systematically contrasts transcription and accessibility to infer the regulatory circuitry driving cells along cell state trajectories. MIRA leverages topic modeling of cell states and regulatory potential modeling of individual gene loci. MIRA thereby represents cell states in an efficient and interpretable latent space, infers high-fidelity cell state trees, determines key regulators of fate decisions at branch points and exposes the variable influence of local accessibility on transcription at distinct loci. Applied to epidermal differentiation and embryonic brain development from two different multimodal platforms, MIRA revealed that early developmental genes were tightly regulated by local chromatin landscape whereas terminal fate genes were titrated without requiring extensive chromatin remodeling.	anndata, networkx, pyfaidx, torch	None	MIRA: joint regulatory modeling of multimodal expression and chromatin accessibility in single cells	61.97567629	35.72516539	10.854201	10.1101/2021.12.06.471401	4	Lynch AW, Theodoris CV, Long HW, Brown M, Liu XS, Meyer CA.

Yet, learning from multimodal data is complicated because of missing and incomplete reference samples, non-overlapping features and batch effects between datasets. To integrate and provide a unified view of multi-modal datasets, we propose Multigrate. Multigrate is a generative multi-view neural network to build multimodal reference atlases. In contrast to existing methods, Multigrate is not limited to specific paired assays, and it compares favorably to existing data-specific methods on both integration and imputation tasks. We further show that Multigrate equipped with transfer learning enables mapping a query multimodal dataset into an existing reference atlas.

Current advances especially in single-cell multi-omics hold high potential for breakthroughs by integration of multiple different omics layers. To pair with the recent biotechnological developments, many computational approaches to process and analyze single-cell multi-omics data have been proposed. In this review, we first introduce recent developments in single-cell multi-omics in general and then focus on the available data integration strategies. The integration approaches are divided into three categories: early, intermediate, and late data integration. For each category, we describe the underlying conceptual principles and main characteristics, as well as provide examples of currently available tools and how they have been applied to analyze single-cell multi-omics data. Finally, we explore the challenges and prospective future directions of single-cell multi-omics data integration, including examples of adopting multi-view analysis approaches used in other disciplines to single-cell multi-omics.

The ability to gather data along an increasing number of omic dimensions has created a need for tools to analyze all of this information together, rather than siloing each technology into separate analysis pipelines. To advance this goal, we introduce a framework called the single-cell multi-modal generative adversarial network (scMMGAN) that integrates data from multiple modalities into a unified representation in the ambient data space for downstream analysis using a combination of adversarial learning and data geometry techniques. The framework’s key improvement is an additional diffusion geometry loss with a new kernel that constrains the otherwise over-parameterized GAN. We demonstrate scMMGAN’s ability to produce more meaningful alignments than alternative methods on a wide variety of data modalities and that its output can be used to draw conclusions from real-world biological experimental data.	tensorflow	CycleGAN, CMAE	Single-cell multi-modal GAN reveals spatial patterns in single-cell data from triple-negative breast cancer	35.53819789	16.27786058	8.08361495	10.1101/2022.07.04.498732	1	Amodio M, Youlten SE, Venkat A, San Juan BP, Chaffer CL, Krishnaswamy S.

Different data modalities provide different perspectives on a population of cells, and their integration is critical for studying cellular heterogeneity and its function. While various methods have been proposed to integrate different sequencing data modalities, coupling imaging and sequencing has been an open challenge. We here present an approach for integrating vastly different modalities by learning a probabilistic coupling between the different data modalities using autoencoders to map to a shared latent space. We validate this approach by integrating single-cell RNA-seq and chromatin images to identify distinct subpopulations of human naive CD4+ T-cells that are poised for activation. Collectively, our approach provides a framework to integrate and translate between data modalities that cannot yet be measured within the same cell for diverse applications in biomedical discovery.	torch	Seurat, DCCA	Multi-domain translation between single-cell imaging and sequencing data using autoencoders	34.61925836	21.61395841	7.554349033	10.1101/2019.12.13.875922	1	Yang KD, Belyaeva A, Venkatachalapathy S, Damodaran K, Katcoff A, Radhakrishnan A, Shivashankar GV, Uhler C.

However, currently, it is challenging to infer the joint representations and learn relationships among multiple modalities from complex multimodal single-cell data. Here, we present scMM, a novel deep generative model-based framework for the extraction of interpretable joint representations and crossmodal generation. scMM addresses the complexity of data by leveraging a mixture-of-experts multimodal variational autoencoder. The pseudocell generation strategy of scMM compensates for the limited interpretability of deep learning models, and the proposed approach experimentally discovered multimodal regulatory programs associated with latent dimensions. Analysis of recently produced datasets validated that scMM facilitates high-resolution clustering with rich interpretability. Furthermore, we show that crossmodal generation by scMM leads to more precise prediction and data integration compared with the state-of-the-art and conventional approaches.	torch	Seurat	A mixture-of-experts deep generative model for integrated analysis of single-cell multiomics data	15.27448206	11.21248951	5.882094292	10.1101/2021.02.18.431907	3	Minoura K, Abe K, Nam H, Nishikawa H, Shimamura T.

However, joint analysis of two modalities without properly handling the noise often leads to overfitting of one modality by the other and worse clustering results than vanilla single-modality analysis. How to efficiently utilize the extra information from single cell multi-omics to delineate cell states and identify meaningful signal remains as a significant computational challenge. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework, named SAILERX, for efficient, robust, and flexible analysis of multi-modal single-cell data. SAILERX consists of a variational autoencoder with invariant representation learning to correct technical noises from sequencing process, and a multimodal data alignment mechanism to integrate information from different modalities. Instead of performing hard alignment by projecting both modalities to a shared latent space, SAILERX encourages the local structures of two modalities measured by pairwise similarities to be similar. This strategy is more robust against overfitting of noises, which facilitates various downstream analysis such as clustering, imputation, and marker gene detection. Furthermore, the invariant representation learning part enables SAILERX to perform integrative analysis on both multi- and single-modal datasets, making it an applicable and scalable tool for more general scenarios.	torch	Seurat, Schema, SAILER, Signac, Cobolt, MAGIC, scOpen	Integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell data with structural similarity	8.438682565	6.156201832	8.938682565	None	3	Cao Y, Fu L, Wu J, Peng Q, Nie Q, Zhang J, Xie X.

The invasion of cancer cells into nearby healthy tissue, accompanied by the infiltration of responding immune cells, results in an even more complex architecture of tumor and non-tumor cells. However, bulk genomics-based methods can only assay the aggregate transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles across all of this rich cellular diversity. Such bulk averaging hides small subpopulations of tumor cells with unique phenotypes that might result in therapeutic resistance or metastatic progression. The advent of single-cell-based genomics assays for measuring transcription and chromatin accessibility – particularly scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq – has enabled the dissection of cell-types within tumors at a scale and resolution capable of unraveling the epigenetic and gene expression programs of rare and unique cellular subpopulations. This Review focuses on recent advances in scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq technologies and their application to cancer biology in the context of furthering our understanding of tumor heterogeneity.

Existing dimension-reduction methods for multimodal data focus on capturing the “union of information,” producing a lower-dimensional embedding that combines the information across modalities. While these tools are useful, we develop Tilted-CCA to quantify the “intersection and difference of information”, that is, a decomposition of a paired multimodal dataset into common axes of variation that is shared between both modalities and distinct axes of variation that is found only in one modality. Through examples, we show that Tilted-CCA enables meaningful visualization and quantification of the cross-modal information overlap. We also demonstrate the application of Tilted-CCA to two specific types of analyses. First, for single-cell experiments that jointly profile the transcriptome and surface antibody markers, we show how to use Tilted-CCA to design the target antibody panel to best complement the transcriptome. Second, for single-cell multiome data that jointly profiles transcriptome and chromatin accessibility, we show how to use the common embedding given by Tilted-CCA to identify development-informative genes and distinguish between transient versus terminal cell types.

To realize this potential, we developed MultiVelo, a differential equation model of gene expression that extends the RNA velocity framework to incorporate epigenomic data. MultiVelo uses a probabilistic latent variable model to estimate the switch time and rate parameters of chromatin accessibility and gene expression and improves the accuracy of cell fate prediction compared to velocity estimates from RNA only. Application to multi-omic single-cell datasets from brain, skin and blood cells reveals two distinct classes of genes distinguished by whether chromatin closes before or after transcription ceases. We also find four types of cell states: two states in which epigenome and transcriptome are coupled and two distinct decoupled states. Finally, we identify time lags between transcription factor expression and binding site accessibility and between disease-associated SNP accessibility and expression of the linked genes.

Recent single-cell technologies such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq have facilitated parallel probing into each of these facets, providing multimodal measurements of individual cells. An integrative analysis of these single-cell modalities can therefore provide a comprehensive understanding of specific cellular and molecular mechanisms. Despite the technological advances, simultaneous profiling of multiple modalities of single cells continues to be challenging as opposed to single modality measurements, and therefore, it may not always be feasible to conduct such profiling experiments (e.g., missing modalities). Furthermore, even with the available multimodalities, data integration remains elusive since modalities may not always have paired samples, leaving partial to no correspondence information. To address those challenges, we developed Cross-Modality Optimal Transport (CMOT), a computational approach to infer missing modalities of single cells based on optimal transport (OT). CMOT first aligns a group of cells (source) within available multi-modal data onto a common latent space. Then, it applies optimal transport to map the cells with a single modality (target) to the aligned cells in source from the same modality by minimizing their cost of transportation using Wasserstein distance. This distance can be regularized by prior knowledge (e.g., cell types) or induced cells clusters to improve mapping, and an entropy of transport to speed up OT computations. Once transported, CMOT uses K-Nearest-Neighbors to infer the missing modality for the cells in target from another modality of mapped cells in source. Furthermore, the alignment of CMOT works for partially corresponding information from multi-modalities, i.e., allowing a fraction of unmatched cells in source. We evaluated CMOT on several emerging multi-modal datasets, e.g., gene and protein expression and chromatin accessibility in developing brain, cancers, and immunology. We found that not only does CMOT outperform existing state-of-art methods, but its inferred gene expression is biologically interpretable such as classifying cell types and cancer types. Finally, CMOT is open source and available on our github: https://github.com/daifengwanglab/CMOT.

Gene expression and chromatin accessibility are measurements from different modalities, and no common features can be directly used to guide integration. Current state-of-the-art methods lack practical solutions for finding heterogeneous clusters. However, previous methods might not generate reliable results when cluster heterogeneity exists. More importantly, current methods lack an effective way to select hyper-parameters under an unsupervised setting. Therefore, applying computational methods to integrate single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility measurements remains difficult. Results: We introduce AIscEA—Alignment-based Integration of single-cell gene Expression and chromatin Accessibility—a computational method that integrates single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility measurements using their biological consistency. AIscEA first defines a ranked similarity score to quantify the biological consistency between cell clusters across measurements. AIscEA then uses the ranked similarity score and a novel permutation test to identify cluster alignment across measurements. AIscEA further utilizes graph alignment for the aligned cell clusters to align the cells across measurements. We compared AIscEA with the competing methods on several benchmark datasets and demonstrated that AIscEA is highly robust to the choice of hyper-parameters and can better handle the cluster heterogeneity problem. Furthermore, AIscEA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods when integrating real-world SNARE-seq and scMultiome-seq datasets in terms of integration accuracy.

However, generating multi-modal data for many cells remains costly and challenging. Thus, missing modalities happens frequently, becoming a major obstacle to understanding mechanisms. Recently, machine learning approaches have been developed to impute cell data but typically use fully matched multi-modal data and learn common latent embeddings that potentially miss modality specificity. To address these issues, we developed a novel machine learning model with open-source tool, Joint variational Autoencoders for Multi-modal Imputation and Embedding (JAMIE). JAMIE takes single-cell multi-modal data that can have partially matched samples across modalities. Variational autoencoders learn the latent embeddings of each modality. Then, embeddings from matched samples across modalities are aggregated to identify joint cross-modal latent embeddings before reconstruction. To perform cross-modal imputation from one to another, the latent embeddings can be used with the opposite decoder. We also use Shapley values to prioritize input features for cross-modal imputation and known sample labels to make JAME interpretable. We applied JAMIE to both simulation data and emerging single-cell multi-modal data such as gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and electrophysiology in human and mouse brains for imputing various modalities and cell types. We found that JAMIE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in most cases and prioritized important multi-modal features for imputation, providing potentially novel mechanistic insights at cellular resolution.

Most existing methods to integrate co-profiled single-cell multi-omics data focus only on learning representations that capture stationary and shared information among these modalities. Current methods do not account for time-dependent and modality-specific information delineating cell states and subtypes, nor do they consider dynamics resulting from causal relations among modalities. For example, open chromatin may cause active transcription; however, it is also possible that gene expression responses lag behind changes in chromatin accessibility. To account for this time lag, the epigenome and transcriptome relationship can be characterized as “coupled” (changing dependently) or “decoupled” (changing independently). We propose the framework HALO (Hierarchical cAusal representation Learning for Omics data), which adopts a causal approach to model these non-stationary causal relations using independent changing mechanisms in co-profiled single-cell ATAC- and RNA-seq data. Our model factorizes these two modalities into both coupled and decoupled latent representations, allowing us to identify the dynamic interplay between chromatin accessibility and transcription through temporal modulations. In blood lineage and developing mouse brain data, where the balance between proliferation and differentiation is tightly regulated, HALO distinguishes between coupled and decoupled genes and links them with disparate processes that constitute these two complementary states.

Contemporary single-cell lineage tracing (scLT) methods use expressed, heritable DNA barcodes to combine cell lineage readout with single-cell transcriptomics enabling high-resolution analysis of cell states while preserving lineage relationships. However, reliance on transcriptional profiling limits their adaptation to an ever-expanding tool kit of multiomic single-cell assays. With CellTag-multi, we present a novel approach for profiling lineage barcodes with single-cell chromatin accessibility without relying on co-assay of transcriptional state, paving the way for truly multiomic lineage tracing. We validate CellTag-multi in mouse hematopoiesis, characterizing transcriptional and epigenomic lineage priming across progenitor cell populations. In direct reprogramming of fibroblasts to endoderm progenitors, we use CellTag-multi to comprehensively link early cell state with reprogramming outcomes, identifying core regulatory programs underlying on-target and off-target reprogramming. Further, we reveal the Transcription Factor (TF) Zfp281 as a novel regulator of reprogramming outcome, biasing cells towards an off-target mesenchymal fate via its regulation of TGF-β signaling. Together, these results establish CellTag-multi as a novel lineage tracing method compatible with multiple single-cell modalities and demonstrate its utility in revealing fate-specifying gene regulatory changes across diverse paradigms of differentiation and reprogramming.

These profiles can reveal the complex interplay of different regulatory layers in single cells; still, new challenges arise when integrating datasets with some features shared across experiments and others exclusive to a single source; combining information across these sources is called mosaic integration. The difficulties lie in imputing missing molecular layers to build a self-consistent atlas, finding a common latent space, and transferring learning to new data sources robustly. Existing mosaic integration approaches based on matrix factorization cannot efficiently adapt to nonlinear embeddings for the latent cell space and are not designed for accurate imputation of missing molecular layers. By contrast, we propose a probabilistic variational autoencoder model, scVAEIT, to integrate and impute multimodal datasets with mosaic measurements. A key advance is the use of a missing mask for learning the conditional distribution of unobserved modalities and features, which makes scVAEIT flexible to combine different panels of measurements from multimodal datasets accurately and in an end-to-end manner. Imputing the masked features serves as a supervised learning procedure while preventing overfitting by regularization. Focusing on gene expression, protein abundance, and chromatin accessibility, we validate that scVAEIT robustly imputes the missing modalities and features of cells biologically different from the training data. scVAEIT also adjusts for batch effects while maintaining the biological variation, which provides better latent representations for the integrated datasets. We demonstrate that scVAEIT significantly improves integration and imputation across unseen cell types, different technologies, and different tissues. Significance Statement Single-cell multimodal assays provide an unprecedented opportunity for investigating heterogeneity of cell types and novel associations with disease and development. Although analyses of such multimodal datasets have the potential to provide new insights that cannot be inferred with a single modality, access typically requires the integration of multiple data sources. We propose a probabilistic variational autoencoder model for mosaic integration, which involves merging data sources that include features shared across datasets and features exclusive to a single data source. Our model is designed to provide a lower dimensional representation of the cells for visualization, clustering, and other downstream tasks; accurate imputation of missing features and observations; and transfer learning for robustly imputing new datasets when only partial measurements are available.	scanpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow	Seurat, totalVI, MultiVI	Robust probabilistic modeling for single-cell multimodal mosaic integration and imputation via scVAEIT	8.024460718	7.003186227	6.824460718	10.1101/2022.07.25.501456	4	Du JH, Cai Z, Roeder K.

We engineered a hybrid transposase including the chromodomain (CD) of the heterochromatin protein-1α (HP-1α), which is involved in heterochromatin assembly and maintenance through its binding to trimethylation of the lysine 9 on histone 3 (H3K9me3), and developed a single-cell method, single-cell genome and epigenome by transposases sequencing (scGET-seq), that, unlike single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (scATAC-seq), comprehensively probes both open and closed chromatin and concomitantly records the underlying genomic sequences. We tested scGET-seq in cancer-derived organoids and human-derived xenograft (PDX) models and identified genetic events and plasticity-driven mechanisms contributing to cancer drug resistance. Next, building upon the differential enrichment of closed and open chromatin, we devised a method, Chromatin Velocity, that identifies the trajectories of epigenetic modifications at the single-cell level. Chromatin Velocity uncovered paths of epigenetic reorganization during stem cell reprogramming and identified key transcription factors driving these developmental processes. scGET-seq reveals the dynamics of genomic and epigenetic landscapes underlying any cellular processes.	htslib, samtools, screen	None	Chromatin Velocity reveals epigenetic dynamics by single-cell profiling of heterochromatin and euchromatin	19.83573251	14.80508483	7.410868497	None	7	Tedesco M, Giannese F, Lazarević D, Giansanti V, Rosano D, Monzani S, Catalano I, Grassi E, Zanella ER, Botrugno OA, Morelli L.

However, progenitor cells are incompletely characterized, especially in the brain, partly because conventional methods are restricted by inadequate throughput and resolution for deciphering cell-type-specific proliferation and differentiation dynamics in vivo. Here, we developed TrackerSci, a new technique that combines in vivo labeling of newborn cells with single-cell combinatorial indexing to profile the single-cell chromatin landscape and transcriptome of rare progenitor cells and track cellular differentiation trajectories in vivo. We applied TrackerSci to analyze the epigenetic and gene expression dynamics of newborn cells across entire mouse brains spanning three age stages and in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Leveraging the dataset, we identified diverse progenitor cell types less-characterized in conventional single cell analysis, and recovered their unique epigenetic signatures. We further quantified the cell-type-specific proliferation and differentiation potentials of progenitor cells, and identified the molecular programs underlying their aging-associated changes (e.g., reduced neurogenesis/oligodendrogenesis). Finally, we expanded our analysis to study progenitor cells in the aged human brain through profiling ∼800,000 single-cell transcriptomes across five anatomical regions from six aged human brains. We further explored the transcriptome signatures that are shared or divergent between human and mouse oligodendrogenesis, as well as the region-specific down-regulation of oligodendrogenesis in the human cerebellum. Together, the data provide an in-depth view of rare progenitor cells in mammalian brains. We anticipate TrackerSci will be broadly applicable to characterize cell-type-specific temporal dynamics in diverse systems.

Computational approaches allow the fusion of diverse single-cell data types, but their efficacy is difficult to validate in the absence of authentic multi-omic measurements. To comprehensively assess the molecular phenotypes of single cells, we devised single-nucleus methylcytosine, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptome sequencing (snmCAT-seq) and applied it to postmortem human frontal cortex tissue. We developed a cross-validation approach using multi-modal information to validate fine-grained cell types and assessed the effectiveness of computational data fusion methods. Correlation analysis in individual cells revealed distinct relations between methylation and gene expression. Our integrative approach enabled joint analyses of the methylome, transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, and conformation for 63 human cortical cell types. We reconstructed regulatory lineages for cortical cell populations and found specific enrichment of genetic risk for neuropsychiatric traits, enabling the prediction of cell types that are associated with diseases.	collections, glob	snRNA-seq, snmC-seq	Single nucleus multi-omics identifies human cortical cell regulatory genome diversity	13.34321194	10.47697625	6.808787776	10.1101/2019.12.11.873398	4	Luo C, Liu H, Xie F, Armand EJ, Siletti K, Bakken TE, Fang R, Doyle WI, Stuart T, Hodge RD, Hu L.

However, the combination of different layers of epigenome sequencing in an individual cell has not yet been achieved. Here, we developed a single-cell multi-omics sequencing technology (single-cell COOL-seq) that can analyze the chromatin state/nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, copy number variation and ploidy simultaneously from the same individual mammalian cell. We used this method to analyze the reprogramming of the chromatin state and DNA methylation in mouse preimplantation embryos. We found that within < 12 h of fertilization, each individual cell undergoes global genome demethylation together with the rapid and global reprogramming of both maternal and paternal genomes to a highly opened chromatin state. This was followed by decreased openness after the late zygote stage. Furthermore, from the late zygote to the 4-cell stage, the residual DNA methylation is preferentially preserved on intergenic regions of the paternal alleles and intragenic regions of maternal alleles in each individual blastomere. However, chromatin accessibility is similar between paternal and maternal alleles in each individual cell from the late zygote to the blastocyst stage. The binding motifs of several pluripotency regulators are enriched at distal nucleosome depleted regions from as early as the 2-cell stage. This indicates that the cis-regulatory elements of such target genes have been primed to an open state from the 2-cell stage onward, long before pluripotency is eventually established in the ICM of the blastocyst. Genes may be classified into homogeneously open, homogeneously closed and divergent states based on the chromatin accessibility of their promoter regions among individual cells. This can be traced to step-wise transitions during preimplantation development. Our study offers the first single-cell and parental allele-specific analysis of the genome-scale chromatin state and DNA methylation dynamics at single-base resolution in early mouse embryos and provides new insights into the heterogeneous yet highly ordered features of epigenomic reprogramming during this process.

Here I adapted Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) to measure chromatin accessibility and endogenous DNA methylation in single cells (scNOMe-seq). scNOMe-seq recovered characteristic accessibility and DNA methylation patterns at DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs). An advantage of scNOMe-seq is that sequencing reads are sampled independently of the accessibility measurement. scNOMe-seq therefore controlled for fragment loss, which enabled direct estimation of the fraction of accessible DHSs within individual cells. In addition, scNOMe-seq provided high resolution of chromatin accessibility within individual loci which was exploited to detect footprints of CTCF binding events and to estimate the average nucleosome phasing distances in single cells. scNOMe-seq is therefore well-suited to characterize the chromatin organization of single cells in heterogeneous cellular mixtures.

Here, we describe a single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and mRNA expression sequencing 2 (SNARE-seq2) assay, implemented with cellular combinatorial indexing. This method involves tagmentation within permeabilized and fixed single-nucleus isolates to capture accessible chromatin (AC) regions, followed by the capture and reverse transcription of RNA transcripts. Through combinatorial split pool ligations, cDNA and AC within each single nucleus become appended with a common cell barcode combination. The captured cDNA and AC are then co-amplified before splitting and enrichment into single-nucleus RNA and single-nucleus AC sequencing libraries. This protocol is compatible with both nuclei and whole cells and can be completed in 3.5 d. SNARE-seq2 permits robust generation of high-quality, joint single-cell RNA and AC sequencing libraries from hundreds of thousands of single cells per experiment.

The states and modifications of chromatin represent critical sources of information for this process. However, the dynamics and interrelations of these chromatin characteristics remain elusive. In this study, we developed an improved scCOOL-seq technique (iscCOOL-seq), which is a multi-omics, single-cell and single-base resolution method with high mapping rates, and explored the chromatin accessibility landscape and its relationship to DNA methylation in growing mouse oocytes. The most dramatic change in chromatin accessibility occurs during oocyte growth initiation, accompanied with prominent transcriptome alterations and an elevated variation in DNA methylation levels among individual oocytes. Unlike CpG islands (CGIs), partially methylated domains (PMDs) are associated with a low density of nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) during the whole maturation period. Surprisingly, highly expressed genes are usually associated with NDRs at their transcriptional end sites (TESs). In addition, genes with de novo methylated gene bodies during oocyte maturation are already open at their promoters before oocyte growth initiation. Furthermore, epigenetic and transcription factors that might be involved in oocyte maturation are identified. Our work paves the way for dissecting the complex, yet highly coordinated, epigenetic alterations during mouse oocyte growth and the establishment of totipotency.

We previously developed a single-cell DNase-seq assay (scDNase-seq) to profile accessible chromatin in a limited number of single cells. Here, we report a novel indexing strategy to resolve single-cell DNase hypersensitivity profiles based on bulk cell analysis. This new technique, termed indexing single-cell DNase sequencing (iscDNase-seq), employs the activities of terminal DNA transferase (TdT) and T4 DNA ligase to add unique cell barcodes to DNase-digested chromatin ends. By a three-layer indexing strategy, it allows profiling genome-wide DHSs for >15 000 single-cells in a single experiment. Application of iscDNase-seq to human white blood cells accurately revealed specific cell types and inferred regulatory transcription factors (TF) specific to each cell type. We found that iscDNase-seq detected DHSs with specific properties related to gene expression and conservation missed by scATAC-seq for the same cell type. Also, we found that the cell-to-cell variation in accessibility computed using iscDNase-seq data is significantly correlated with the cell-to-cell variation in gene expression. Importantly, this correlation is significantly higher than that between scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq, suggesting that iscDNase-seq data can better predict the cellular heterogeneity in gene expression compared to scATAC-seq. Thus, iscDNase-seq is an attractive alternative method for single-cell epigenomics studies.	fast-dump	scATAC-seq	Multiplex indexing approach for the detection of DNase I hypersensitive sites in single cells	3.234557128	2.764485439	3.625342285	None	1	Gao W, Ku WL, Pan L, Perrie J, Zhao T, Hu G, Wu Y, Zhu J, Ni B, Zhao K.

Single-cell-omic technologies provide an avenue for understanding the mechanisms of these processes by capturing the progression of epigenetic cell states during the course of cellular differentiation using in vitro or in vivo models. However, current single-cell epigenomic methods are limited in the information garnered per individual cell, which in turn limits their ability to measure chromatin dynamics and state shifts. Single-cell combinatorial indexing (sci-) has been applied as a strategy for identifying single-cell-omic originating libraries and removes the necessity of single-cell, single-compartment chemistry. Here, we report an improved sci-assay for transposase accessible chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq), which utilizes the small molecule inhibitor Pitstop 2™ (scip-ATAC-seq). We demonstrate that these improvements, which theoretically could be applied to any in situ transposition method for single-cell library preparation, significantly increase the ability of transposase to enter the nucleus and generate highly complex single-cell libraries, without altering biological signal. We applied sci-ATAC-seq and scip-ATAC-seq to characterize the chromatin dynamics of developing forebrain-like organoids, an in vitro model of human corticogenesis4. Using these data, we characterized novel putative regulatory elements, compared the epigenome of the organoid model to human cortex data, generated a high-resolution pseudotemporal map of chromatin accessibility through differentiation, and measured epigenomic changes coinciding with a neurogenic fate decision point. Finally, we combined transcription factor motif accessibility with gene activity (GA) scores to directly observe the dynamics of complex regulatory programs that regulate neurogenesis through developmental pseudotime. Overall, scip-ATAC-seq increases information content per cell and bolsters the potential for future single-cell studies into complex developmental processes.

Single-cell DNase sequencing (scDNase-seq) is a method of detecting genome-wide DHSs when starting with either single cells or <1,000 cells from primary cell sources. This technique enables genome-wide mapping of hypersensitive sites in a wide range of cell populations that cannot be analyzed using conventional DNase I sequencing because of the requirement for millions of starting cells. Fresh cells, formaldehyde-cross-linked cells or cells recovered from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue slides are suitable for scDNase-seq assays. To generate scDNase-seq libraries, cells are lysed and then digested with DNase I. Circular carrier plasmid DNA is included during subsequent DNA purification and library preparation steps to prevent loss of the small quantity of DHS DNA. Libraries are generated for high-throughput sequencing on the Illumina platform using standard methods. Preparation of scDNase-seq libraries requires only 2 d. The materials and molecular biology techniques described in this protocol should be accessible to any general molecular biology laboratory. Processing of high-throughput sequencing data requires basic bioinformatics skills and uses publicly available bioinformatics software.

While methods for multiomic profiling have been reported, their adoption has been limited due to high cost and complex workflows. Here, a simple method for joint profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in tens to hundreds of single cells is presented. Assessed herein is the quality of resulting single cell ATAC- and RNA-seq data across three cell types, examining the link between accessibility and expression at the CD3G and FTH1 loci in human primary T cells and monocytes, and comparing the accuracy of clustering solutions for mono-omic and combined data. The new method allows biological laboratories to perform simultaneous profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility using standard reagents and instrumentation. This technique, in conjunction with other advances in multiomic profiling, will enable highly resolved cell state classification and more specific mechanistic hypothesis generation than is possible with mono-omic analysis.

However, it remains largely unclear how the drastic epigenetic reprogramming contributes to transcriptional regulatory network during this period. Here, we develop a single-cell multiomics sequencing technology (scNOMeRe-seq) that enables profiling of genome-wide chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression in the same individual cell. We apply this method to depict a single-cell multiomics map of mouse preimplantation development. We find that genome-wide DNA methylation remodeling facilitates the reconstruction of genetic lineages in early embryos. Further, we construct a zygotic genome activation (ZGA)-associated regulatory network and reveal coordination among multiple epigenetic layers, transcription factors and repeat elements that instruct proper ZGA. Cell fates associated cis-regulatory elements are activated stepwise in post-ZGA stages. Trophectoderm (TE)-specific transcription factors play dual roles in promoting the TE program while repressing the inner cell mass (ICM) program during the ICM/TE separation.

To increase the scale of these atlases, lower the cost and pave the way for more specialized multiome assays, custom droplet microfluidics may provide solutions complementary to commercial setups. We developed HyDrop, a flexible and open-source droplet microfluidic platform encompassing three protocols. The first protocol involves creating dissolvable hydrogel beads with custom oligos that can be released in the droplets. In the second protocol, we demonstrate the use of these beads for HyDrop-ATAC, a low-cost noncommercial scATAC-seq protocol in droplets. After validating HyDrop-ATAC, we applied it to flash-frozen mouse cortex and generated 7996 high-quality single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles in a single run. In the third protocol, we adapt both the reaction chemistry and the capture sequence of the barcoded hydrogel bead to capture mRNA, and demonstrate a significant improvement in throughput and sensitivity compared to previous open-source droplet-based scRNA-seq assays (Drop-seq and inDrop). Similarly, we applied HyDrop-RNA to flash-frozen mouse cortex and generated 9508 single-cell transcriptomes closely matching reference single-cell gene expression data. Finally, we leveraged HyDrop-RNA’s high capture rate to analyze a small population of fluorescence-activated cell sorted neurons from the Drosophila brain, confirming the protocol’s applicability to low input samples and small cells. HyDrop is currently capable of generating single-cell data in high throughput and at a reduced cost compared to commercial methods, and we envision that HyDrop can be further developed to be compatible with novel (multi) omics protocols.	anndata, cisTopic, scanpy	inDrop	Hydrop enables droplet-based single-cell ATAC-seq and single-cell RNA-seq using dissolvable hydrogel beads	6.503412601	5.931133118	5.142778598	10.1101/2021.06.04.447104	3	De Rop FV, Ismail JN, González-Blas CB, Hulselmans GJ, Flerin CC, Janssens J, Theunis K, Christiaens VM, Wouters J, Marcassa G, de Wit J.

Emerging techniques for the interrogation of chromatin accessibility in individual cells allow investigation of the fundamental mechanisms that lead to the variability of different cells. This protocol describes a fast and robust method for single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling based on the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq). The method combines up-front bulk Tn5 tagging of chromatin with flow cytometry to isolate single nuclei or cells. Reagents required to generate sequencing libraries are added to the same well in the plate where cells are sorted. The protocol described here generates data of high complexity and excellent signal-to-noise ratio and can be combined with index sorting for in-depth characterization of cell types. The whole experimental procedure can be finished within 1 or 2 d with a throughput of hundreds to thousands of nuclei, and the data can be processed by the provided computational pipeline. The execution of the protocol only requires basic techniques and equipment in a molecular biology laboratory with flow cytometry support.

Here, we present a transposome-assisted single nucleus barcoding approach for ATAC-seq (SNuBar-ATAC) that utilizes a single oligonucleotide adaptor for multiplexing samples during the existing tagmentation step and does not require a pre-labeling procedure. The accuracy and scalability of SNuBar-ATAC was evaluated using cell line mixture experiments. We applied SNuBar-ATAC to investigate treatment-induced chromatin accessibility dynamics by multiplexing 28 mice with lung tumors that received different combinations of chemo, radiation, and targeted immunotherapy. We also applied SNuBar-ATAC to study spatial epigenetic heterogeneity by multiplexing 32 regions from a human breast tissue. Additionally, we show that SNuBar can multiplex single cell ATAC and RNA multiomic assays in cell lines and human breast tissue samples. Our data show that SNuBar is a highly accurate, easy-to-use, and scalable system for multiplexing scATAC-seq and scATAC and RNA co-assay experiments.

Profiling nucleosome positioning genome-wide in single cells provides critical information to understand the cell-to-cell heterogeneity of chromatin states within a cell population. This protocol describes single-cell micrococcal nuclease sequencing (scMNase-seq), a method for detecting genome-wide nucleosome positioning and chromatin accessibility simultaneously from a small number of cells or single cells. To generate scMNase-seq libraries, single cells are isolated by FACS sorting, lysed and digested by MNase. DNA is purified, end-repaired and ligated to Y-shaped adaptors. Following PCR amplification with indexing primers, the subnucleosome-sized (fragments with a length of ≤80 bp) and mononucleosome-sized (fragments with a length between 140 and 180 bp) DNA fragments are recovered and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq platforms. On average, 0.5–1 million unique mapped reads are obtained for each single cell. The mononucleosome-sized DNA fragments precisely define genome-wide nucleosome positions in single cells, while the subnucleosome-sized DNA fragments provide information on chromatin accessibility. Library preparation of scMNase-seq takes only 2 d, requires only standard molecular biology techniques and does not require sophisticated laboratory equipment.

In this strategy, the T cell genome is modified by the integration of lentiviral vectors encoding CAR that direct tumor cell killing. However, this therapeutic approach is often limited by the extent of CAR-T cell expansion in vivo. A major outstanding question is whether or not CAR-T integration itself enhances the proliferative competence of individual T cells by rewiring their regulatory landscape. To address this question, it is critical to define the identity of an individual CAR-T cell and simultaneously chart where the CAR-T vector integrates into the genome. Here, we report the development of a method called EpiVIA (https://github.com/VahediLab/epiVIA) for the joint profiling of the chromatin accessibility and lentiviral integration site analysis at the population and single-cell levels. We validate our technique in clonal cells with previously defined integration sites and further demonstrate the ability to measure lentiviral integration sites and chromatin accessibility of host and viral genomes at the single-cell resolution in CAR-T cells. We anticipate that EpiVIA will enable the single-cell deconstruction of gene regulation during CAR-T therapy, leading to the discovery of cellular factors associated with durable treatment.

However, the low detection efficiency of current methods has limited our understanding of the true complexity of chromatin accessibility and its relationship with gene expression in single cells. Here, we report a high-sensitivity scATAC-seq method, termed multiplexed end-tagging amplification of transposase accessible chromatin (METATAC), which detects a large number of accessible sites per cell and is compatible with automation. Our high detectability and statistical framework allowed precise linking of enhancers to promoters without merging single cells. We systematically investigated allele-specific accessibility in the mouse cerebral cortex, revealing allele-specific accessibility of promotors of certain imprinted genes but biallelic accessibility of their enhancers. Finally, we combined METATAC with our high-sensitivity single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) method, multiple annealing and looping based amplification cycles for digital transcriptomics (MALBAC-DT), to develop a joint ATAC–RNA assay, termed METATAC and MALBAC-DT coassay by sequencing (M2C-seq).

While the chromatin accessibility landscape of this process has been explored in defined populations, single-cell regulatory variation has been hidden by ensemble averaging. We collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles across 10 populations of immunophenotypically defined human hematopoietic cell types and constructed a chromatin accessibility landscape of human hematopoiesis to characterize differentiation trajectories. We find variation consistent with lineage bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent cell types. We observe heterogeneity within common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and develop a strategy to partition GMPs along their differentiation trajectory.

Here, we assess the performance of a massively parallel droplet-based method for mapping transposase-accessible chromatin in single cells using sequencing (scATAC-seq). We apply scATAC-seq to obtain chromatin profiles of more than 200,000 single cells in human blood and basal cell carcinoma. In blood, application of scATAC-seq enables marker-free identification of cell type-specific cis- and trans-regulatory elements, mapping of disease-associated enhancer activity and reconstruction of trajectories of cellular differentiation. In basal cell carcinoma, application of scATAC-seq reveals regulatory networks in malignant, stromal and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of scATAC-seq profiles from serial tumor biopsies before and after programmed cell death protein 1 blockade identifies chromatin regulators of therapy-responsive T cell subsets and reveals a shared regulatory program that governs intratumoral CD8+ T cell exhaustion and CD4+ T follicular helper cell development. We anticipate that scATAC-seq will enable the unbiased discovery of gene regulatory factors across diverse biological systems.

Although effective genetic labeling approaches are available in model systems, in humans, most approaches require detection of nuclear somatic mutations, which have high error rates, limited scale, and do not capture cell state information. Here, we show that somatic mutations in mtDNA can be tracked by single-cell RNA or assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC) sequencing. We leverage somatic mtDNA mutations as natural genetic barcodes and demonstrate their utility as highly accurate clonal markers to infer cellular relationships. We track native human cells both in vitro and in vivo and relate clonal dynamics to gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Our approach should allow clonal tracking at a 1,000-fold greater scale than with nuclear genome sequencing, with simultaneous information on cell state, opening the way to chart cellular dynamics in human health and disease.

Here, we provide a single-cell resource of chromatin accessibility for murine mammary development from the peak of fetal mammary stem cell (fMaSC) functional activity in late embryogenesis to the differentiation of adult basal and luminal cells. We find that the chromatin landscape within individual cells predicts both gene accessibility and transcription factor activity. The ability of single-cell chromatin profiling to separate E18 fetal mammary cells into clusters exhibiting basal-like and luminal-like chromatin features is noteworthy.

To identify genomic regions crucial to corticogenesis, we mapped the activity of gene-regulatory elements generating a single-cell atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility both independently and jointly. This revealed waves of gene regulation by key transcription factors (TFs) across a nearly continuous differentiation trajectory, distinguished the expression programs of glial lineages, and identified lineage-determining TFs that exhibited strong correlation between linked gene-regulatory elements and expression levels. These highly connected genes adopted an active chromatin state in early differentiating cells, consistent with lineage commitment. Base-pair-resolution neural network models identified strong cell-type-specific enrichment of noncoding mutations predicted to be disruptive in a cohort of ASD individuals and identified frequently disrupted TF binding sites. This approach illustrates how cell-type-specific mapping can provide insights into the programs governing human development and disease.

We developed a machine-learning classifier to integrate this multi-omic framework and predict dozens of functional SNPs for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, nominating target genes and cell types for previously orphaned loci from genome-wide association studies. Moreover, we dissected the complex inverted haplotype of the MAPT (encoding tau) Parkinson’s disease risk locus, identifying putative ectopic regulatory interactions in neurons that may mediate this disease association.

Recent advances in measuring gene expression in single cells are providing new insights into lineage commitment. However, the regulatory events underlying these changes remain unclear. Here we investigate the dynamics of chromatin regulatory landscapes during embryogenesis at single-cell resolution. Using single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for transposase accessible chromatin with sequencing (sci-ATAC-seq)1, we profiled chromatin accessibility in over 20,000 single nuclei from fixed Drosophila melanogaster embryos spanning three landmark embryonic stages: 2–4 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 5 blastoderm nuclei), when each embryo comprises around 6,000 multipotent cells; 6–8 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 10–11), to capture a midpoint in embryonic development when major lineages in the mesoderm and ectoderm are specified; and 10–12 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 13), when each of the embryo’s more than 20,000 cells are undergoing terminal differentiation. Our results show that there is spatial heterogeneity in the accessibility of the regulatory genome before gastrulation, a feature that aligns with future cell fate, and that nuclei can be temporally ordered along developmental trajectories. During mid-embryogenesis, tissue granularity emerges such that individual cell types can be inferred by their chromatin accessibility while maintaining a signature of their germ layer of origin. Analysis of the data reveals overlapping usage of regulatory elements between cells of the endoderm and non-myogenic mesoderm, suggesting a common developmental program that is reminiscent of the mesendoderm lineage in other species2,3,4. We identify 30,075 distal regulatory elements that exhibit tissue-specific accessibility. We validated the germ-layer specificity of a subset of these predicted enhancers in transgenic embryos, achieving an accuracy of 90%. Overall, our results demonstrate the power of shotgun single-cell profiling of embryos to resolve dynamic changes in the chromatin landscape during development, and to uncover the cis-regulatory programs of metazoan germ layers and cell types.

Higashi outperforms existing methods for embedding and imputation of scHi-C data and is able to identify multiscale 3D genome features in single cells, such as compartmentalization and TAD-like domain boundaries, allowing refined delineation of their cell-to-cell variability. Moreover, Higashi can incorporate epigenomic signals jointly profiled in the same cell into the hypergraph representation learning framework, as compared to separate analysis of two modalities, leading to improved embeddings for single-nucleus methyl-3C data. In an scHi-C dataset from human prefrontal cortex, Higashi identifies connections between 3D genome features and cell-type-specific gene regulation.

However, single cell Hi-C (scHi-C) data suffer severely from sparsity, that is, the existence of excess zeros due to insufficient sequencing depth. Complicating the matter further is the fact that not all zeros are created equal: some are due to loci truly not interacting because of the underlying biological mechanism (structural zeros); others are indeed due to insufficient sequencing depth (sampling zeros or dropouts), especially for loci that interact infrequently. Differentiating between structural zeros and dropouts is important since correct inference would improve downstream analyses such as clustering and discovery of subtypes. Nevertheless, distinguishing between these two types of zeros has received little attention in the single cell Hi-C literature, where the issue of sparsity has been addressed mainly as a data quality improvement problem. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose HiCImpute, a Bayesian hierarchical model that goes beyond data quality improvement by also identifying observed zeros that are in fact structural zeros. HiCImpute takes spatial dependencies of scHi-C 2D data structure into account while also borrowing information from similar single cells and bulk data, when such are available. Through an extensive set of analyses of synthetic and real data, we demonstrate the ability of HiCImpute for identifying structural zeros with high sensitivity, and for accurate imputation of dropout values. Downstream analyses using data improved from HiCImpute yielded much more accurate clustering of cell types compared to using observed data or data improved by several comparison methods. Most significantly, HiCImpute-improved data have led to the identification of subtypes within each of the excitatory neuronal cells of L4 and L5 in the prefrontal cortex.

Conceptually Hi-C data counts interaction frequencies between every position in the genome and every other position. Biologically functional interactions are expected to occur more frequently than transient background and artefactual interactions. To identify biologically relevant interactions, several background models that take biases such as distance, GC content and mappability into account have been proposed. Here we introduce MaxHiC, a background correction tool that deals with these complex biases and robustly identifies statistically significant interactions in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C experiments. MaxHiC uses a negative binomial distribution model and a maximum likelihood technique to correct biases in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C libraries. We systematically benchmark MaxHiC against major Hi-C background correction tools including Hi-C significant interaction callers (SIC) and Hi-C loop callers using published Hi-C, capture Hi-C, and Micro-C datasets. Our results demonstrate that 1) Interacting regions identified by MaxHiC have significantly greater levels of overlap with known regulatory features (e.g. active chromatin histone marks, CTCF binding sites, DNase sensitivity) and also disease-associated genome-wide association SNPs than those identified by currently existing models, 2) the pairs of interacting regions are more likely to be linked by eQTL pairs and 3) more likely to link known regulatory features including known functional enhancer-promoter pairs validated by CRISPRi than any of the existing methods. We also demonstrate that interactions between different genomic region types have distinct distance distributions only revealed by MaxHiC. MaxHiC is publicly available as a python package for the analysis of Hi-C, capture Hi-C and Micro-C data.	numpy, pandas, scipy, tensorflow	GOTHiC, CHiCAGO, Fit-Hi-C, Fit-Hi-C2, HiC-DC+, HiCCUPS, Peakachu, Mustache	MaxHiC: A robust background correction model to identify biologically relevant chromatin interactions in Hi-C and capture Hi-C experiments	8.394061521	6.815629424	9.670744835	None	4	Alinejad-Rokny H, Ghavami Modegh R, Rabiee HR, Ramezani Sarbandi E, Rezaie N, Tam KT, Forrest AR.

However, algorithms that can use Hi-C data for a full-range SV detection have been severely lacking. Current methods can only identify interchromosomal translocations and long-range intrachromosomal SVs (>1 Mb) at less-than-optimal resolution. Therefore, we develop EagleC, a framework that combines deep-learning and ensemble-learning strategies to predict a full range of SVs at high resolution. We show that EagleC can uniquely capture a set of fusion genes that are missed by whole-genome sequencing or nanopore. Furthermore, EagleC also effectively captures SVs in other chromatin interaction platforms, such as HiChIP, Chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), and capture Hi-C. We apply EagleC in more than 100 cancer cell lines and primary tumors and identify a valuable set of high-quality SVs. Last, we demonstrate that EagleC can be applied to single-cell Hi-C and used to study the SV heterogeneity in primary tumors.	cooler, cython, joblib, matplotlib, pyBigWig, pyensembl, scikit-learn, statsmodels, tensorflow	Hi-C breakfinder, HiCtrans, HiNT-TL	EagleC: A deep-learning framework for detecting a full range of structural variations from bulk and single-cell contact maps	48.80816451	26.7176843	10.59259809	None	3	Wang X, Luan Y, Yue F.

However, the extremely sparse nature of scHi-C data poses a significant barrier to analysis, limiting our ability to tease out hidden biological information. In this work, we approach this problem by applying topic modeling to scHi-C data. Topic modeling is well-suited for discovering latent topics in a collection of discrete data. For our analysis, we generate nine different single-cell combinatorial indexed Hi-C (sci-Hi-C) libraries from five human cell lines (GM12878, H1Esc, HFF, IMR90, and HAP1), consisting over 19,000 cells. We demonstrate that topic modeling is able to successfully capture cell type differences from sci-Hi-C data in the form of “chromatin topics.” We further show enrichment of particular compartment structures associated with locus pairs in these topics.

However, balancing high-resolution and genome wide-coverage remains challenging. We describe a computational method for the reconstruction of large 3D-ensembles of single-cell (sc) chromatin conformations from population Hi-C that we apply to study embryogenesis in Drosophila. With minimal assumptions of physical properties and without adjustable parameters, our method generates large ensembles of chromatin conformations via deep-sampling. Our method identifies specific interactions, which constitute 5–6% of Hi-C frequencies, but surprisingly are sufficient to drive chromatin folding, giving rise to the observed Hi-C patterns. Modeled sc-chromatins quantify chromatin heterogeneity, revealing significant changes during embryogenesis. Furthermore, >50% of modeled sc-chromatin maintain topologically associating domains (TADs) in early embryos, when no population TADs are perceptible. Domain boundaries become fixated during development, with strong preference at binding-sites of insulator-complexes upon the midblastula transition. Overall, high-resolution 3D-ensembles of sc-chromatin conformations enable further in-depth interpretation of population Hi-C, improving understanding of the structure-function relationship of genome organization.

Several methods are available for studying chromosome architecture, each with different strengths and limitations. Established imaging approaches and proximity ligation-based chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques (such as DNA-FISH and Hi-C, respectively) have revealed the existence of chromosome territories, functional nuclear landmarks (such as splicing speckles and the nuclear lamina) and topologically associating domains. Improvements to these methods and the recent development of ligation-free approaches, including GAM, SPRITE and ChIA-Drop, are now helping to uncover new aspects of 3D genome topology that confirm the nucleus to be a complex, highly organized organelle.

Genome Architecture Mapping (GAM) is the first genome-wide experimental method for capturing 3D proximities between any number of genomic loci without ligation. GAM overcomes several limitations of 3C-based methods by sequencing DNA from a large collection of thin sections sliced from individual nuclei. The GAM technique measures locus co-segregation, extracts radial positions, infers chromatin compaction, requires small numbers of cells, does not depend on ligation, and provides rich single-cell information. However, previous analyses of GAM data focused exclusively on population averages, neglecting the variation in 3D topology among individual cells. We present the first single-cell analysis of GAM data, demonstrating that the slices from individual cells reveal intercellular heterogeneity in chromosome conformation. By simultaneously clustering both slices and genomic loci, we identify topological variation among single cells, including differential compaction of cell cycle genes. We also develop a geometric model of the nucleus, allowing prediction of the 3D positions of each slice. Using GAM data from mouse embryonic stem cells, we make new discoveries about the structure of the major mammalian histone gene locus, which is incorporated into the Histone Locus Body (HLB), including structural fluctuations and putative causal molecular mechanisms. Our methods are packaged as SluiceBox, a toolkit for mining GAM data. Our approach represents a new method of investigating variation in 3D genome topology among individual cells across space and time.

To cluster thousands of single-cell Hi-C interaction matrices they are flattened and compiled into one matrix. This matrix can, depending on the resolution, have a few millions or even billions of features and any computation with it is therefore memory demanding. A common approach to reduce the number of features is to compute a nearest neighbors graph. However, the exact euclidean distance computation is in O(n2) and therefore we present an implementation of an approximate nearest neighbors method based on local sensitive hashing running in O(n). The presented method is able to process a 10kb single-cell Hi-C data set with 2500 cells and needs 53 GB of memory while the exact k-nearest neighbors approach is not computable with 1 TB of memory.

However, excess zeros are commonly seen in single cell Hi-C (scHi-C) data, making scHi-C matrices extremely sparse and bringing extra difficulties in downstream analysis. The observed zeros are a combination of two events: structural zeros for which the loci never interact due to underlying biological mechanisms, and dropouts or sampling zeros where the two loci interact but are not captured due to insufficient sequencing depth. Although quality improvement approaches have been proposed as an intermediate step for analyzing scHi-C data, little has been done to address these two types of zeros. We believe that differentiating between structural zeros and dropouts would benefit downstream analysis such as clustering. Results We propose scHiCSRS, a self-representation smoothing method that improves the data quality, and a Gaussian mixture model that identifies structural zeros among observed zeros. scHiC-SRS not only takes spatial dependencies of a scHi-C 2D data structure into account but also borrows information from similar single cells. Through an extensive set of simulation studies, we demonstrate the ability of scHiCSRS for identifying structural zeros with high sensitivity and for accurate imputation of dropout values in sampling zeros. Downstream analysis for three real datasets show that data improved from scHiCSRS yield more accurate clustering of cells than simply using observed data or improved data from several comparison methods.

However, existing scHi-C analysis methods are hindered by the data quality and complex 3D genome patterns. The lack of computational scalability and interpretability poses further challenges for large-scale analysis. Here, we introduce Fast-Higashi, an ultrafast and interpretable method based on tensor decomposition and partial random walk with restart, enabling joint identification of cell identities and chromatin meta-interactions from sparse scHi-C data. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the advantage of Fast-Higashi over existing methods, leading to improved delineation of rare cell types and continuous developmental trajectories. Fast-Higashi can directly identify 3D genome features that define distinct cell types and help elucidate cell-type-specific connections between genome structure and function. Moreover, Fast-Higashi can generalize to incorporate other single-cell omics data. Fast-Higashi provides a highly efficient and interpretable scHi-C analysis solution that is applicable to a broad range of biological contexts.	cython, h5py, numpy, opt_einsum, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, seaborn, torch, tqdm, umap-learn	Higashi, 3DVI, scHiCluster	Ultrafast and interpretable single-cell 3D genome analysis with Fast-Higashi	38.92690881	20.99879691	10.69777007	10.1101/2022.04.18.488683	5	Zhang R, Zhou T, Ma J.

The rapid growth of the field has been fueled by the development of innovative single-cell Hi-C protocols. However, the protocols vary considerably in their efficiency, bias, scale and costs, and their relative advantages for different applications are unclear. Here, we compare the two most commonly used single-cell Hi-C protocols. We use long-read sequencing to analyze molecular products of the Hi-C assay and show that whole-genome amplification step results in increased number of artifacts, larger coverage biases, and increased amount of noise compared to PCR-based amplification.

ScHiC-Rep	None	4	dimensionality reduction, imputation	imputation, dimensionality reduction	ScHiC-Rep is a novel framework for single-cell Hi-C data representation and clustering.	10.1101/2021.04.30.442215	Preprint	Preprint		2022.12.02	2022.12.02		graph convolution, random walk, autoencoder	CIS	2021.04.30	None			3		The three-dimensional genome structure plays a key role in cellular function and gene regulation. Singlecell Hi-C technology can capture genome structure information at the cell level, which provides the opportunity to study how genome structure varies among different cell types. However, few methods are well designed for single-cell Hi-C clustering, because of high sparsity, noise and heterogeneity of single-cell Hi-C data. In this manuscript, we propose a novel framework, named ScHiC-Rep, for singlecell Hi-C data representation and clustering. ScHiC-Rep mainly contains two parts: data imputation and feature extraction. In the imputation part, a novel imputation workflow is proposed, including graph convolution-based, random walk with restart-based and genomic neighbor-based imputation. In the feature extraction part, a two-phase feature extraction method is proposed, including linear phase for chromosome level and non-linear phase for cell level feature extraction. The evaluation results show that the proposed framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on both human and mouse datasets.

However, Hi-C data analysis requires methods that take into account the unique characteristics of this type of data. In this work, we explore whether methods that have been developed previously for the analysis of bulk Hi-C data can be applied to scHi-C data. We apply methods designed for analysis of bulk Hi-C data to scHi-C data in conjunction with unsupervised embedding. Results: We find that one of these methods, HiCRep, when used in conjunction with multidimensional scaling (MDS), strongly outperforms three other methods, including a technique that has been used previously for scHi-C analysis. We also provide evidence that the HiCRep/MDS method is robust to extremely low per-cell sequencing depth, that this robustness is improved even further when high-coverage and low-coverage cells are projected together, and that the method can be used to jointly embed cells from multiple published datasets.

However, how the 3D genome organization and its dynamics influence cellular phenotypes remains poorly understood. The very recent development of single-cell technologies for probing the 3D genome, especially single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C), has ushered in a new era of unveiling cell-to-cell variability of 3D genome features at an unprecedented resolution. Here, we review recent developments in computational approaches to the analysis of scHi-C, including data processing, dimensionality reduction, imputation for enhancing data quality, and the revealing of 3D genome features at single-cell resolution. While much progress has been made in computational method development to analyze single-cell 3D genomes, substantial future work is needed to improve data interpretation and multimodal data integration, which are critical to reveal fundamental connections between genome structure and function among heterogeneous cell populations in various biological contexts.

While bulk Hi-C data sets contain contact information derived from millions of cells and can capture major structural features shared by the majority of cells in the sample, they do not provide information about local variability between cells. Single-cell Hi-C can overcome this problem, but contact matrices are generally very sparse, making structural inference more problematic. We have developed a Bayesian multiscale approach, named Structural Inference via Multiscale Bayesian Approach, to infer 3D structures of chromosomes from single-cell Hi-C while including the bulk Hi-C data and some regularization terms as a prior. We study the landscape of solutions for each single-cell Hi-C data set as a function of prior strength and demonstrate clustering of solutions using data from the same cell.	numpy, scipy	None	Bayesian Estimation of Three-Dimensional Chromosomal Structure from Single-Cell Hi-C Data	26.77827576	13.38495761	5.686627163	None	2	Rosenthal M, Bryner D, Huffer F, Evans S, Srivastava A, Neretti N.

There are a limited number of computational tools that can model the 3D structures of chromosomes based on single-cell Hi-C data. Results: We developed single-cell lattice (SCL), a computational method to reconstruct 3D structures of chromosomes based on single-cell Hi-C data. We designed a loss function and a 2 D Gaussian function specifically for the characteristics of single-cell Hi-C data. A chromosome is represented as beads-on-a-string and stored in a 3 D cubic lattice. Metropolis–Hastings simulation and simulated annealing are used to simulate the structure and minimize the loss function. We evaluated the SCL-inferred 3 D structures (at both 500 and 50 kb resolutions) using multiple criteria and compared them with the ones generated by another modeling software program. The results indicate that the 3 D structures generated by SCL closely fit single-cell Hi-C data. We also found similar patterns of trans-chromosomal contact beads, Lamin-B1 enriched topologically associating domains (TADs), and H3K4me3 enriched TADs by mapping data from previous studies onto the SCL-inferred 3 D structures.

Single-cell analysis of genome architecture has been achieved using imaging and chromatin conformation capture methods such as Hi-C. To study variation in chromosome structure between different cell types, computational approaches are needed that can utilize sparse and heterogeneous single-cell Hi-C data. However, few methods exist that are able to accurately and efficiently cluster such data into constituent cell types. Here, we describe scHiCluster, a single-cell clustering algorithm for Hi-C contact matrices that is based on imputations using linear convolution and random walk. Using both simulated and real single-cell Hi-C data as benchmarks, scHiCluster significantly improves clustering accuracy when applied to low coverage datasets compared with existing methods. After imputation by scHiCluster, topologically associating domain (TAD)-like structures (TLSs) can be identified within single cells, and their consensus boundaries were enriched at the TAD boundaries observed in bulk cell Hi-C samples. In summary, scHiCluster facilitates visualization and comparison of single-cell 3D genomes.	anndata, clodius, cooler, h5py, joblib, numcodecs, numpy, pandas, rpy2, scikit-learn, scipy, statsmodels, tables, xarray, zarr	PCA, HiCRep, Eigenvector, Decay	Robust single-cell Hi-C clustering by convolution- and random-walk–based imputation	46.36698194	26.43175545	10.034597	None	2	Zhou J, Ma J, Chen Y, Cheng C, Bao B, Peng J, Sejnowski TJ, Dixon JR, Ecker JR.

This is very useful since many biological processes are correlated with DNA folding, such as DNA transcription. However, the methods for the analysis of such conformations are still lacking mathematical guarantees and statistical power. To handle this issue, we propose to use the Mapper, which is a standard tool of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) that allows one to efficiently encode the inherent continuity and topology of underlying biological processes in data, in the form of a graph with various features such as branches and loops. In this article, we show how recent statistical techniques developed in TDA for the Mapper algorithm can be extended and leveraged to formally define and statistically quantify the presence of topological structures coming from biological phenomena, such as the cell cyle, in datasets of CCC contact maps.

Recently it became possible to study single cells with Hi-C, a genome-wide 3C variant, demonstrating a high cell-to-cell variability of genome organization. In principle, restraint-based modeling should allow us to infer the 3D structure of chromosomes from single-cell contact data, but suffers from the sparsity and low resolution of chromosomal contacts. To address these challenges, we adapt the Bayesian Inferential Structure Determination (ISD) framework, originally developed for NMR structure determination of proteins, to infer statistical ensembles of chromosome structures from single-cell data. Using ISD, we are able to compute structural error bars and estimate model parameters, thereby eliminating potential bias imposed by ad hoc parameter choices. We apply and compare different models for representing the chromatin fiber and for incorporating singe-cell contact information. Finally, we extend our approach to the analysis of diploid chromosome data.	csb, numpy, scipy	ShRec3D, MBO, SA	Inferential Structure Determination of Chromosomes from Single-Cell Hi-C Data	13.82729815	7.362166308	5.45415595	None	1	Carstens S, Nilges M, Habeck M.

Complicating things further is the fact that dropouts are confounded with structural zeros due to underlying properties, leading to observed zeros being a mixture of both types of events. Although a great deal of progress has been made in imputing dropout events for single cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, little has been done in identifying structural zeros and imputing dropouts for scHiC data. In this paper, we adapted several methods from the single-cell RNA-seq literature for inference on observed zeros in scHiC data and evaluated their effectiveness. Through an extensive simulation study and real data analysis, we have shown that a couple of the adapted single-cell RNA-seq algorithms can be powerful for correctly identifying structural zeros and accurately imputing dropout values. Downstream analysis using the imputed values showed considerable improvement for clustering cells of the same types together over clustering results before imputation.

Here, we present GiniQC, which quantifies unevenness in the distribution of inter-chromosomal reads in the scHi-C contact matrix to measure the level of noise. Our examples show the utility of GiniQC in assessing the quality of scHi-C data as a complement to existing quality control measures.

However, the prevalence and dynamics of TAD-like domains in single cells remain elusive. Here we develop a new algorithm, named deTOKI, to decode TAD-like domains with single-cell Hi-C data. By non-negative matrix factorization, deTOKI seeks regions that insulate the genome into blocks with minimal chance of clustering. deTOKI outperforms competing tools and reliably identifies TAD-like domains in single cells. Finally, we find that TAD-like domains are not only prevalent, but also subject to tight regulation in single cells.	numpy, pandas, scikit-learn	SpectralTAD, GRiNCH, scHiCluster, Insulation Score, deDoc	DeTOKI identifies and characterizes the dynamics of chromatin TAD-like domains in a single cell	13.0652664	12.64967737	9.856313379	None	9	Li X, Zeng G, Li A, Zhang Z.

Although the price of sequencing has been dropping dramatically, high-resolution Hi-C data are not always an option for many studies, such as in single cells. However, the performance of current computational methods based on Hi-C at the ultra-sparse data condition has yet to be fully assessed. Therefore, in this paper, after briefly surveying the primary computational methods for Hi-C data analysis, we assess the performance of representative methods on data normalization, identification of compartments, Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) and chromatin loops under the condition of ultra-low resolution. We showed that most state-of-the-art methods do not work properly for that condition. Then, we applied the three best-performing methods on real single-cell Hi-C data, and their performance indicates that compartments may be a statistical feature emerging from the cell population, while TADs and chromatin loops may dynamically exist in single cells.

While mapping genomes in 3D has for a long time been elusive, recent adaptations of high-throughput sequencing to chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques, allows for genome-wide structural characterization for the first time. However, reconstruction of ""consensus"" 3D genomes from 3C-based data is a challenging problem, since the data are aggregated over millions of cells. Recent single-cell adaptations to the 3C-technique, however, allow for non-aggregated structural assessment of genome structure, but data suffer from sparse and noisy interaction sampling. We present a manifold based optimization (MBO) approach for the reconstruction of 3D genome structure from chromosomal contact data. We show that MBO is able to reconstruct 3D structures based on the chromosomal contacts, imposing fewer structural violations than comparable methods. Additionally, MBO is suitable for efficient high-throughput reconstruction of large systems, such as entire genomes, allowing for comparative studies of genomic structure across cell-lines and different species."

Here, we present SnapHiC-D, a computational pipeline to identify differential chromatin contacts (DCCs) between two scHi-C datasets. Compared to methods designed for bulk Hi-C data, SnapHiC-D detects DCCs with high sensitivity and accuracy. We used SnapHiC-D to identify celltype-specific chromatin contacts at 10 kilobase resolution in mouse hippocampal and human prefrontal cortical tissues, and demonstrated that DCCs detected in the cortical and hippocampal cell types are generally correlated with cell-type-specific gene expression patterns and epigenomic features.

However, exhaustive analysis of regulatory factor binding or elements for preference of the formation of chromatin domains in single cells has not yet emerged. To this end, we first develop a hierarchical chromatin domain structure identification algorithm (named as HiCS) from individual single-cell Hi-C maps, with superior performance in both accuracy and efficiency. The results suggest that in addition to the known CTCF-cohesin complex, Polycomb, TrxG, pluripotent protein families and other multiple factors also contribute to shaping chromatin domain boundaries in single embryonic stem cells. Different cooperation patterns of regulatory factors decipher the preference of genomic position categories forming boundaries.

The development of single-cell Hi-C technology makes it possible to obtain batches of single-cell Hi-C data. How to quickly and effectively discriminate cell types has become one hot research field. However, the existing computational methods to predict cell types based on Hi-C data are found to be low in accuracy. Therefore, we propose a high accuracy cell classification algorithm, called scHiCStackL, based on single-cell Hi-C data. In our work, we first improve the existing data preprocessing method for single-cell Hi-C data, which allows the generated cell embedding better to represent cells. Then, we construct a two-layer stacking ensemble model for classifying cells. Experimental results show that the cell embedding generated by our data preprocessing method increases by 0.23, 1.22, 1.46 and 1.61[Math Processing Error]% comparing with the cell embedding generated by the previously published method scHiCluster, in terms of the Acc, MCC, F1 and Precision confidence intervals, respectively, on the task of classifying human cells in the ML1 and ML3 datasets. When using the two-layer stacking ensemble framework with the cell embedding, scHiCStackL improves by 13.33, 19, 19.27 and 14.5 over the scHiCluster, in terms of the Acc, ARI, NMI and F1 confidence intervals, respectively. In summary, scHiCStackL achieves superior performance in predicting cell types using the single-cell Hi-C data.

Single-cell Hi-C interaction matrices are high dimensional and very sparse. To cluster thousands of single-cell Hi-C interaction matrices, they are flattened and compiled into one matrix. Depending on the resolution, this matrix can have a few million or even billions of features; therefore, computations can be memory intensive. We present a single-cell Hi-C clustering approach using an approximate nearest neighbors method based on locality-sensitive hashing to reduce the dimensions and the computational resources. Results: The presented method can process a 10 kb single-cell Hi-C dataset with 2600 cells and needs 40 GB of memory, while competitive approaches are not computable even with 1 TB of memory. It can be shown that the differentiation of the cells by their chromatin folding properties and, therefore, the quality of the clustering of single-cell Hi-C data is advantageous compared to competitive algorithms.

How to construct a pseudotime path using single-cell Hi-C contact matrices to order cells along developmental trajectory is a challenging topic, since these matrices produced by the technology are inherently high dimensional and sparse, they suffer from noises and biases, and the topology of trajectory underlying them may be diverse. Results: We present scHiCPTR, an unsupervised graph-based pipeline to infer pseudotime from single-cell Hi-C contact matrices. It provides a workflow consisting of imputation and embedding, graph construction, dual graph refinement, pseudotime calculation and result visualization. Beyond the few existing methods, scHiCPTR ties to optimize graph structure by two parallel procedures of graph pruning, which help reduce the spurious cell links resulted from noises and determine a global developmental directionality. Besides, it has an ability to handle developmental trajectories with multiple topologies, including linear, bifurcated and circular ones, and is competitive with methods developed for single-cell RNA-seq data. The comparative results tell that our scHiCPTR can achieve higher performance in pseudotime inference, and the inferred developmental trajectory exhibit a reasonable biological significance.

The maternal genome inherited from the oocyte and the paternal genome provided by sperm coexist as separate haploid nuclei in the zygote. How these two epigenetically distinct genomes are spatially organized is poorly understood. Existing chromosome conformation capture-based methods2,3,4,5 are not applicable to oocytes and zygotes owing to a paucity of material. To study three-dimensional chromatin organization in rare cell types, we developed a single-nucleus Hi-C (high-resolution chromosome conformation capture) protocol that provides greater than tenfold more contacts per cell than the previous method2. Here we show that chromatin architecture is uniquely reorganized during the oocyte-to-zygote transition in mice and is distinct in paternal and maternal nuclei within single-cell zygotes. Features of genomic organization including compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops are present in individual oocytes when averaged over the genome, but the presence of each feature at a locus varies between cells. At the sub-megabase level, we observed stochastic clusters of contacts that can occur across TAD boundaries but average into TADs. Notably, we found that TADs and loops, but not compartments, are present in zygotic maternal chromatin, suggesting that these are generated by different mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that the global chromatin organization of zygote nuclei is fundamentally different from that of other interphase cells. An understanding of this zygotic chromatin ‘ground state’ could potentially provide insights into reprogramming cells to a state of totipotency.

Despite this, profiling of three-dimensional genome structure from complex tissues with cell-type specific resolution remains challenging. Recent efforts have demonstrated that cell-type specific epigenomic features can be resolved in complex tissues using single-cell assays. However, it remains unclear whether single-cell chromatin conformation capture (3C) or Hi-C profiles can effectively identify cell types and reconstruct cell-type specific chromatin conformation maps. To address these challenges, we have developed single-nucleus methyl-3C sequencing to capture chromatin organization and DNA methylation information and robustly separate heterogeneous cell types. Applying this method to >4,200 single human brain prefrontal cortex cells, we reconstruct cell-type specific chromatin conformation maps from 14 cortical cell types. These datasets reveal the genome-wide association between cell-type specific chromatin conformation and differential DNA methylation, suggesting pervasive interactions between epigenetic processes regulating gene expression.

Protein A in fusion to Tn5 transposase is enriched through specific antibodies to genomic regions, and Tn5 generates indexed chromatin fragments ready for library preparation and sequencing. Importantly, this strategy enables not only low-input epigenomic profiling in intact tissues but also measures scalable up to tens of thousands of single cells per experiment under both native and cross-linked conditions. CoBATCH produces ∼12,000 reads/cell with extremely low background.

Here we develop CoTECH, a combinatorial barcoding method allowing high-throughput single-cell joint detection of chromatin occupancy and transcriptome. We used CoTECH to examine bivalent histone marks (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) with transcription from naive to primed mouse embryonic stem cells. We also derived concurrent bivalent marks in pseudosingle cells using transcriptome as an anchor for resolving pseudotemporal bivalency trajectories and disentangling a context-specific interplay between H3K4me3/H3K27me3 and transcription level. Next, we revealed the regulatory basis of endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition in two waves of hematopoietic cells and distinctive enhancer-gene-linking schemes guiding hemogenic endothelial cell emergence, indicating a unique epigenetic control of transcriptional regulation for hematopoietic stem cell priming. CoTECH provides an efficient framework for single-cell coassay of chromatin occupancy and transcription, thus enabling higher-dimensional epigenomic reconstructions.

However, they do not permit analysis with single-cell resolution, thus confounding analyses of heterogeneous cell populations. Here we present a method that permits visualization of histone modifications of single genomic loci with single-cell resolution in formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections based on combined use of in situ hybridization and proximity ligation assays. We show that dimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me2) at the MYH11 locus is restricted to the smooth muscle cell (SMC) lineage in human and mouse tissue sections and that the mark persists even in phenotypically modulated SMC in atherosclerotic lesions that show no detectable expression of SMC marker genes. This methodology has promise for broad applications in the study of epigenetic mechanisms in complex multicellular tissues in development and disease.

We report a method to map NL contacts genome-wide in single human cells. Analysis of nearly 400 maps reveals a core architecture consisting of gene-poor LADs that contact the NL with high cell-to-cell consistency, interspersed by LADs with more variable NL interactions. The variable contacts tend to be cell-type specific and are more sensitive to changes in genome ploidy than the consistent contacts. Single-cell maps indicate that NL contacts involve multivalent interactions over hundreds of kilobases. Moreover, we observe extensive intra-chromosomal coordination of NL contacts, even over tens of megabases. Such coordinated loci exhibit preferential interactions as detected by Hi-C. Finally, the consistency of NL contacts is inversely linked to gene activity in single cells and correlates positively with the heterochromatic histone modification H3K9me3. These results highlight fundamental principles of single-cell chromatin organization.

How chromatin states, at euchromatic and heterochromatic regions, underlie cell fate decisions in single cells is relatively unexplored. We develop sort assisted single-cell chromatin immunocleavage (sortChIC) and map active (H3K4me1 and H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3 and H3K9me3) histone modifications in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), and mature blood cells in the mouse bone marrow. During differentiation, HSPCs acquire distinct active chromatin states that depend on the specific cell fate, mediated by cell type-specifying transcription factors. By contrast, most regions that gain or lose repressive marks during differentiation do so independent of cell fate. Joint profiling of H3K4me1 and H3K9me3 demonstrates that cell types within the myeloid lineage have distinct active chromatin but share similar myeloid-specific heterochromatin-repressed states. This suggests hierarchical chromatin regulation during hematopoiesis: heterochromatin dynamics define differentiation trajectories and lineages, while euchromatin dynamics establish cell types within lineages.	biopython, cached_property, colorama, docutils, lxml, matplotlib, more-itertools, numpy, pandas, pyBigWig, pysam, pysamiterators, pytest, pytest-cov, scikit-learn, seaborn, setuptools, snakemake, tabulate, wheel	None	Hierarchical chromatin regulation during blood formation uncovered by singlecell sortChIC	22.33045659	14.27678717	5.437707671	10.1101/2021.04.26.440606	2	Zeller P, Yeung J, de Barbanson BA, Gaza HV, Florescu M, van Oudenaarden A.

Here we present an integrated experimental and computational framework, scChIX (single-cell chromatin immunocleavage and unmixing), to map multiple histone modifications in single cells. scChIX multiplexes two histone modification profiles together in single cells, then computationally deconvolves the signal using training data from respective histone modification profiles. We first validate this method using purified blood cells and show that although the two repressive marks, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, are generally mutually exclusive, the transitions between the two regions can vary between cell types. Next we apply scChIX to a heterogenous cell population from mouse bone marrow to generate linked maps of active (H3K4me1) and repressive (H3K27me3) chromatin landscapes in single cells, where coordinates in the active modification map correspond to coordinates in the repressive map. Linked analysis reveals that immunoglobulin genes in the Igkv region are in a repressed chromatin state in pro-B cells, but become activated in B cells. Overall, scChIX unlocks systematic interrogation of the interplay between histone modifications in single cells.	biopython, cached_property, colorama, docutils, lxml, matplotlib, more-itertools, numpy, pandas, pyBigWig, pysam, pysamiterators, pytest, pytest-cov, scikit-learn, seaborn, setuptools, snakemake, tabulate, wheel	None	Deconvolving multiplexed histone modifications in single cells	22.71936416	15.03241742	5.771153046	10.1101/2021.04.26.440629	3	Yeung J, Florescu M, Zeller P, de Barbanson BA, van Oudenaarden A.

Here, we adapt the recently published CUT&Tag method3 to scalable single-cell platforms to profile chromatin landscapes in single cells (scCUT&Tag) from complex tissues. We focus on profiling Polycomb Group (PcG) silenced regions marked by H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in single cells as an orthogonal approach to chromatin accessibility for identifying cell states. We show that scCUT&Tag profiling of H3K27me3 distinguishes cell types in human blood and allows the generation of cell-type-specific PcG landscapes from heterogeneous tissues. Furthermore, we use scCUT&Tag to profile H3K27me3 in a brain tumor patient before and after treatment, identifying cell types in the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in PcG activity in the primary sample and after treatment.	pybedtools, scanpy	None	Single-cell analysis of chromatin silencing programs in development and tumor progression	27.91130834	14.7480582	5.801185909	10.1101/2020.09.04.282418	2	Wu SJ, Furlan SN, Mihalas AB, Kaya-Okur HS, Feroze AH, Emerson SN, Zheng Y, Carson K, Cimino PJ, Keene CD, Sarthy JF.

Here we map fusion-specific targets across the genome for diverse KMT2A oncofusion proteins in cell lines and patient samples. By modifying CUT&Tag chromatin profiling for full automation, we identify common and tumor-subtype-specific sites of aberrant chromatin regulation induced by KMT2A oncofusion proteins. A subset of KMT2A oncofusion-binding sites are marked by bivalent (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) chromatin signatures, and single-cell CUT&Tag profiling reveals that these sites display cell-to-cell heterogeneity suggestive of lineage plasticity. In addition, we find that aberrant enrichment of H3K4me3 in gene bodies is sensitive to Menin inhibitors, demonstrating the utility of automated chromatin profiling for identifying therapeutic vulnerabilities. Thus, integration of automated and single-cell CUT&Tag can uncover epigenomic heterogeneity within patient samples and predict sensitivity to therapeutic agents.	numpy, pandas, pybedtools, scipy, seaborn	None	Automated CUT&Tag profiling of chromatin heterogeneity in mixed-lineage leukemia	21.75433809	10.46937328	5.306620394	10.1101/2020.10.06.328948	1	Janssens DH, Meers MP, Wu SJ, Babaeva E, Meshinchi S, Sarthy JF, Ahmad K, Henikoff S.

However, the degree and variability of chromatin modifications in specific human immune cells remain largely unknown. Here, we employ a highly multiplexed mass cytometry analysis to profile the global levels of a broad array of chromatin modifications in primary human immune cells at the single-cell level. Our data reveal markedly different cell-type- and hematopoietic-lineage-specific chromatin modification patterns. Differential analysis between younger and older adults shows that aging is associated with increased heterogeneity between individuals and elevated cell-to-cell variability in chromatin modifications. Analysis of a twin cohort unveils heritability of chromatin modifications and demonstrates that aging-related chromatin alterations are predominantly driven by non-heritable influences. Together, we present a powerful platform for chromatin and immunology research. Our discoveries highlight the profound impacts of aging on chromatin modifications.

Running an scHTPM experiment and analyzing the data produced remains, however, a challenging task since few consensus guidelines exist currently regarding good practices for experimental design and data analysis pipelines. Methods We perform a computational benchmark to assess the impact of experimental parameters and of the data analysis pipeline on the ability of the cell representation produced to recapitulate known biological similarities. We run more than ten thousands experiments to systematically study the impact of coverage and number of cells, of the count matrix construction method, of feature selection and normalization, and of the dimension reduction algorithm used. Results The analysis of the benchmark results allows us to identify key experimental parameters and computational choices to obtain a good representation of single-cell HPTM data. We show in particular that the count matrix construction step has a strong influence on the quality of the representation, and that using fixed-size bin counts outperforms annotation-based binning; that dimension reduction methods based on latent semantic indexing outperform others; and that feature selection is detrimental, while keeping only high-quality cells has little influence on the final representation as long as enough cells are analyzed.

Meanwhile, almost all current technologies suffer from the inherent problem of detecting low coverage of the number of CpGs. Therefore, addressing the inherent sparsity of raw data is essential for quantitative analysis of the whole genome. Results: Here, we reported CaMelia, a CatBoost gradient boosting method for predicting the missing methylation states based on the locally paired similarity of intercellular methylation patterns. On real single-cell methylation datasets, CaMelia yielded significant imputation performance gains over previous methods. Furthermore, applying the imputed data to the downstream analysis of cell-type identification, we found that CaMelia helped to discover more intercellular differentially methylated loci that were masked by the sparsity in raw data, and the clustering results demonstrated that CaMelia could preserve cell-cell relationships and improve the identification of cell types and cell subpopulations.	catboost	DeepCpG, LightCpG, RF	CaMelia: imputation in single-cell methylomes based on local similarities between cells	10.04597733	7.132295453	5.897640217	None	2	Tang J, Zou J, Fan M, Tian Q, Zhang J, Fan S.

The study of DNA methylation can provide an insight into the mechanism behind human health and can also have a positive effect on the assessment of human health status. However, the available sequencing technology is limited by incomplete CpG coverage. Therefore, it is crucial to discover an efficient and convenient method capable of distinguishing between the states of CpG sites. Previous studies focused on identifying methylation states of the CpG sites in single cell, which only evaluated sequence information or structural information. Results: In this paper, we propose a novel model, LightCpG, which combines the positional features with the sequence and structural features to provide information on the CpG sites at two stages. Next, we used the LightGBM model for training of the CpG site identification, and further utilized sample extraction and merged features to reduce the training time. Our results indicate that our method achieves outstanding performance in recognition of DNA methylation. The average AUC values of our method using the 25 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC) cell datasets and six human heptoplastoma-derived (HepG2) cell datasets were 0.9616 and 0.9213, respectively. Moreover, the average training times for our method on the HCC and HepG2 datasets were 8.3 and 5.06 s, respectively. Furthermore, the computational complexity of our model was much lower compared with other available methods that detect methylation states of the CpG sites. Conclusions: In summary, LightCpG is an accurate model for identifying the DNA methylation status of CpG sites in single cells. Furthermore, three types of feature extraction methods and two strategies used in LightCpG are helpful for other prediction problems.	keras, lightgbm, scikit-learn, xgboost	DeepCpG	LightCpG: a multi-view CpG sites detection on single-cell whole genome sequence data	3.149654377	3.324900177	3.704876074	None	2	Jiang L, Wang C, Tang J, Guo F.

We develop a linear modeling framework, SSrGE, to link eeSNVs associated with gene expression. In all the datasets tested, eeSNVs achieve better accuracies than gene expression for identifying subpopulations. Previously validated cancer-relevant genes are also highly ranked, confirming the significance of the method. Moreover, SSrGE is capable of analyzing coupled DNA-seq and RNA-seq data from the same single cells, demonstrating its value in integrating multi-omics single cell techniques.

scDeconv	R	0	other	multi-omics deconvolution	A mathod to solve the reference deficiency problem of DNAm data and deconvolve them from scRNA-seq data in a trans-omics manner.	10.1093/bib/bbac150	Briefings in Bioinformatics	Published	https://github.com/yuabrahamliu/scDeconv/blob/main/DESCRIPTION	2022.12.07	2022.12.07	2022.09.05	constrained linear model	Meth	2022.04.23	MIT	0		2	2	Many DNA methylation (DNAm) data are from tissues composed of various cell types, and hence cell deconvolution methods are needed to infer their cell compositions accurately. However, a bottleneck for DNAm data is the lack of cell-type-specific DNAm references. On the other hand, scRNA-seq data are being accumulated rapidly with various cell-type transcriptomic signatures characterized, and also, many paired bulk RNA-DNAm data are publicly available currently. Hence, we developed the R package scDeconv to use these resources to solve the reference deficiency problem of DNAm data and deconvolve them from scRNA-seq data in a trans-omics manner. It assumes that paired samples have similar cell compositions. So the cell content information deconvolved from the scRNA-seq and paired RNA data can be transferred to the paired DNAm samples. Then an ensemble model is trained to fit these cell contents with DNAm features and adjust the paired RNA deconvolution in a co-training manner. Finally, the model can be used on other bulk DNAm data to predict their relative cell-type abundances. The effectiveness of this method is proved by its accurate deconvolution on the three testing datasets here, and if given an appropriate paired dataset, scDeconv can also deconvolve other omics, such as ATAC-seq data. Furthermore, the package also contains other functions, such as identifying cell-type-specific inter-group differential features from bulk DNAm data. scDeconv is available at: https://github.com/yuabrahamliu/scDeconv.

Integrating various components of the epigenome into multi-omics measurements allows for studying cellular heterogeneity at different time scales and for discovering new layers of molecular connectivity between the genome and its functional output. Measurements that are increasingly available range from those that identify transcription factor occupancy and initiation of transcription to long-lasting and heritable epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation. Together with techniques in which cell lineage is recorded, this multilayered information will provide insights into a cell’s past history and its future potential. This will allow new levels of understanding of cell fate decisions, identity, and function in normal development, physiology, and disease.

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised manifold alignment algorithm, MMD-MA, for integrating multiple measurements carried out on disjoint aliquots of a given population of cells. Effectively, MMD-MA performs an in silico co-assay by embedding cells measured in different ways into a learned latent space. In the MMD-MA algorithm, single-cell data points from multiple domains are aligned by optimizing an objective function with three components: (1) a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) term to encourage the differently measured points to have similar distributions in the latent space, (2) a distortion term to preserve the structure of the data between the input space and the latent space, and (3) a penalty term to avoid collapse to a trivial solution. Notably, MMD-MA does not require any correspondence information across data modalities, either between the cells or between the features. Furthermore, MMD-MA's weak distributional requirements for the domains to be aligned allow the algorithm to integrate heterogeneous types of single cell measures, such as gene expression, DNA accessibility, chromatin organization, methylation, and imaging data. We demonstrate the utility of MMD-MA in simulation experiments and using a real data set involving single-cell gene expression and methylation data.

However, computational tools for analyzing single-cell methylome data are lagging far behind. A number of tasks, including cell type calling and integration with transcriptome data, requires the construction of a robust gene activity matrix as the prerequisite but challenging task. The advent of multi-omics data enables measurement of both DNA methylation and gene expression for the same single cells. Although such data is rather sparse, they are sufficient to train supervised models that capture the complex relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression and predict gene activities at single-cell level. Here, we present methylome association by predictive linkage to expression (MAPLE), a computational framework that learns the association between DNA methylation and expression using both gene- and cell-dependent statistical features. Using multiple data sets generated with different experimental protocols, we show that using predicted gene activity values significantly improves several analysis tasks, including clustering, cell type identification, and integration with transcriptome data. Application of MAPLE revealed several interesting biological insights into the relationship between methylation and gene expression, including asymmetric importance of methylation signals around transcription start site for predicting gene expression, and increased predictive power of methylation signals in promoters located outside CpG islands and shores. With the rapid accumulation of single-cell epigenomics data, MAPLE provides a general framework for integrating such data with transcriptome data.	doSNOW, glmnet, keras	MPD	Predictive modeling of single-cell DNA methylome data enhances integration with transcriptome data	4.525211754	5.183557395	4.838790907	10.1101/2020.06.05.137000	4	Uzun Y, Wu H, Tan K.

However, the data deficiency such as low read mapping ratio is still a critical issue. Results: We comprehensively characterize single-cell BS-seq data and reveal chimerical molecules to be the major source of alignment failures. These chimerical molecules are produced by recombination of genomic proximal sequences with microhomology regions (MR) after bisulfite conversion. In addition, we find DNA methylation within MR is highly variable, suggesting the necessity of removing these regions to accurately estimate DNA methylation levels. We further develop scBS-map to perform quality control and local alignment of bisulfite sequencing data, chimerical molecule determination and MR removal. Using scBS-map, we show remarkable increases in uniquely mapped reads, genomic coverage and number of CpG sites, and recover more functional elements with precise DNA methylation estimation.	bowtie2, samtools	None	Using local alignment to enhance single-cell bisulfite sequencing data efficiency	15.46738111	11.22509313	4.661641917	None	3	Wu P, Gao Y, Guo W, Zhu P.

To date, only snapshots of different mouse and human cell types have been generated, providing a static view on DNA methylation. To enable monitoring of methylation status as it changes over time, we establish a reporter of genomic methylation (RGM) that relies on a minimal imprinted gene promoter driving a fluorescent protein. We show that insertion of RGM proximal to promoter-associated CpG islands reports the gain or loss of DNA methylation. We further utilized RGM to report endogenous methylation dynamics of non-coding regulatory elements, such as the pluripotency-specific super enhancers of Sox2 and miR290.

This, in turn, impedes our ability to tackle key biological questions that pertain to variation within a population, such as identification of disease-associated genes at a cell-type-specific resolution. Here, we show mathematically and empirically that cell-type-specific methylation levels of an individual can be learned from its tissue-level bulk data, conceptually emulating the case where the individual has been profiled with a single-cell resolution and then signals were aggregated in each cell population separately. Provided with this unprecedented way to perform powerful large-scale epigenetic studies with cell-type-specific resolution, we revisit previous studies with tissue-level bulk methylation and reveal novel associations with leukocyte composition in blood and with rheumatoid arthritis. For the latter, we further show consistency with validation data collected from sorted leukocyte sub-types.

The recently developed computational methods for addressing the sparsity by imputing missing have their limits when the required minimum data coverage or profiles of the same tissue in other modalities are not available. In this study, we explored the use of transfer learning together with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to train predictive models for completing methylome profiles with very low coverage (below 2%). Transfer learning was used to leverage less sparse profiles that are typically available for different tissues for the same species, while KL divergence was employed to maximize the usage of information carried in the input data. A deep neural network was adopted to extract both DNA sequence and local methylation patterns for imputation. Our study of training models for completing methylome profiles of bovine oocytes and early embryos demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning and KL divergence, with individual increase of 29.98 and 29.43%, respectively, in prediction performance and 38.70% increase when the two were used together. The drastically increased data coverage (43.80–73.6%) after imputation powers downstream analyses involving methylomes that cannot be effectively done using the very low coverage profiles (0.06–1.47%) before imputation.	pytest, scipy, tensorflow	None	Completing Single-Cell DNA Methylome Profiles via Transfer Learning Together With KL-Divergence	4.41497976	4.696414114	4.41497976	None	3	Dodlapati S, Jiang Z, Sun J.

A computational tool to predict single-cell methylation levels based on single-cell Hi-C data becomes necessary due to the availability of this experiment. scHiMe was developed to predict the base-pair-specific methylation levels in the promoter regions genome-wide based on the single-cell Hi-C data and DNA nucleotide sequences using the graph transformer algorithm. Promoter-promoter spatial interaction networks were built based on single-cell Hi-C data, and single-cell DNA methylation levels on 1000 base pairs for each promoter were predicted based on the network topology and DNA sequence. Our evaluation results showed a high consistency between the predicted and the true methylation values. We tested using predicted DNA methylation levels on all promoters to classify cells into different cell types, and our results showed that the predicted DNA methylation levels resulted in almost perfect cell-type classification, which indicated that our predictions maintained the cell-to-cell variability. We also tested using the predicted DNA methylation levels of different subsets of promoters and different subsets of CpGs in promoters to classify cells and provided the promoters and CpGs that were most influential in cell-type clustering. Moreover, we observed slightly better performance for the nodes that have higher degree values in the promoter-promoter spatial interaction network but did not find a similar trend for more significant network influencers. Last but not least, we found that using the predicted methylation levels of only housekeeping genes led to less accurate cell-type clustering, which demonstrated that our methylation predictions fit the biological meanings of housekeeping genes since housekeeping genes usually have constant and similar genetic and epigenetic features among different types of cells. scHiMe is freely available at http://dna.cs.miami.edu/scHiMe/.

The mechanisms of T1D genetic risk remain poorly understood. Here, we present a multi-omic integrative study of single-cell/nucleus molecular profiles of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the same biological samples from healthy and beta-cell autoantibody+ (AAB+) human pancreatic islets to characterize mechanisms of islet-mediated T1D genetic risk. We additionally performed single-cell/nucleus multi-omic profiling of healthy islets under two stimulatory conditions used as in vitro models of T1D (cytokine cocktail and CVB4 infection) to evaluate how environmental exposures recapitulate multi-omic signatures of T1D. In total, we analyzed 121,272 cells/nuclei across 34 libraries, identifying 10 distinct cell types. We identified cell-type-specific and disease-associated cis-regulatory elements and nominated likely target genes. We provide evidence that T1D genetic risk is mediated through multiple pancreatic cell populations, including islet endocrine cells (beta, alpha, gamma, and delta), exocrine acinar and ductal cells, and immune cells. Finally, we identified three independent T1D risk variants acting through pancreatic islet endocrine cells at the TOX, RASGRP1, and DLK1/MEG3 loci. Together, this work improves our understanding of how non-coding genetic variants encode T1D risk through a complex interplay of different cell types in the pancreas.

Clustering analysis with single-cell multi-omics data may give us novel perspectives to dissect cellular heterogeneity. However, multi-omics data have the properties of inherited large dimension, high sparsity and existence of doublets. Moreover, representations of different omics from even the same cell follow diverse distributions. Without proper distribution alignment techniques, clustering methods will encounter less separable clusters easily affected by less informative omics data. Results We developed MoClust, a novel joint clustering framework that can be applied to several types of single-cell multi-omics data. A selective automatic doublet detection module that can identify and filter out doublets is introduced in the pretraining stage to improve data quality. Omics-specific autoencoders are introduced to characterize the multi-omics data. A contrastive learning way of distribution alignment is adopted to adaptively fuse omics representations into an omics-invariant representation. This novel way of alignment boosts the compactness and separableness of clusters, while accurately weighting the contribution of each omics to the clustering object. Extensive experiments, over both simulated and real multi-omics datasets, demonstrated the powerful alignment, doublet detection and clustering ability features of MoClust.

The available protocols and multi-omics datasets [including parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data profiled from the same cell] are growing increasingly. However, such data are highly sparse and tend to have high level of noise, making data analysis challenging. The methods that integrate the multi-omics data can potentially improve the capacity of revealing the cellular heterogeneity. Results We propose an adaptively weighted multi-view learning (scAWMV) method for the integrative analysis of parallel scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data profiled from the same cell. scAWMV considers both the difference in importance across different modalities in multi-omics data and the biological connection of the features in the scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. It generates biologically meaningful low-dimensional representations for the transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles via unsupervised learning. Application to four real datasets demonstrates that our framework scAWMV is an efficient method to dissect cellular heterogeneity for single-cell multi-omics data.

Single-cell Hi-C (high-resolution chromosome conformation capture) technology can capture genome structure information at the cell level, which provides the opportunity to study how genome structure varies among different cell types. Recently, a few methods are well designed for single-cell Hi-C clustering. In this manuscript, we perform an in-depth benchmark study of available single-cell Hi-C data clustering methods to implement an evaluation system for multiple clustering frameworks based on both human and mouse datasets. We compare eight methods in terms of visualization and clustering performance. Performance is evaluated using four benchmark metrics including adjusted rand index, normalized mutual information, homogeneity and Fowlkes–Mallows index. Furthermore, we also evaluate the eight methods for the task of separating cells at different stages of the cell cycle based on single-cell Hi-C data.

However, scATAC-seq data posed challenges for data analysis because of its near binarization, high sparsity, and ultra-high dimensionality properties. Here we proposed a novel network diffusion-based method to comprehensively analyze scATAC-seq data, named Single-Cell ATAC-seq Analysis via Network Refinement with Peaks Location Information (SCARP). By modeling the prior probability of co-accessibility between adjacent peaks as a decreasing function of genomic distance, SCARP is the first scATAC-seq analysis method that utilizes the genomic information of peaks, which contributed to characterizing co-accessibility of peaks. SCARP used network to model the accessible relationships between cells and peaks, aggregated information with the diffusion method, and then performed dimensionality reduction to obtain low-dimensional cell embeddings as well as peak embeddings. We have demonstrated through sufficient experiments that SCARP facilitated superior analysis of scATAC-seq data. Specifically, SCARP exhibited outstanding cell clustering performance to better elucidate cell heterogeneity, and can be used to reveal new biologically significant cell subpopulations. SCARP was also instrumental in portraying co-accessibility relationships of accessible regions and providing new insight into transcriptional regulation, and those SCARP-derived genes were involved in some key KEGG pathways related to diseases. To sum up, our studies suggested that SCARP is a promising tool to comprehensively analyze the scATAC-seq data from a new perspective.

Although there are experimental challenges to simultaneously profile multiple features on the same single cell, recent computational methods can align the cells from unpaired multi-omic datasets. However, studying regulation also requires us to map the genomic features across different measurements. Unfortunately, most single-cell multi-omic alignment tools cannot perform these alignments or need prior knowledge. We introduce SCOOTR, a co-optimal transport-based method, which jointly aligns both cells and genomic features of unpaired single-cell multi-omic datasets. We apply SCOOTR to various single-cell multi-omic datasets with different types of measurements. Our results show that SCOOTR provides quality alignments for unsupervised celllevel and feature-level integration of datasets with sparse feature correspondences (e.g., one-to-one mappings). For datasets with dense feature correspondences (e.g., many-to-many mappings), our joint framework allows us to provide supervision on one level (e.g., cell types), thus improving alignment performance on the other (e.g., genomic features) or vice-versa. The unique joint alignment framework makes SCOOTR a helpful hypothesis-generation tool for the integrative study of unpaired single-cell multi-omic datasets.	numpy, ot, pandas, scikit-learn	MMD-MA, UnionCom, SCOT, Pamona, bindSC	Jointly aligning cells and genomic features of single-cell multi-omics data with co-optimal transport	8.531794529	8.746547591	9.501070027	10.1101/2022.11.09.515883	7	Demetci P, Tran QH, Redko I, Singh R.

Integrating the resulting multimodal single-cell data to find cell-to-cell correspondences remains a challenge. We argue that data integration needs to happen at a meaningful biological level of abstraction and that it is necessary to consider the inherent discrepancies between modalities to strike a balance between biological discovery and noise removal. A survey of current methods reveals that a distinction between technical and biological origins of presumed unwanted variation between datasets is not yet commonly considered. The increasing availability of paired multimodal data will aid the development of improved methods by providing a ground truth on cell-to-cell matches.

Accordingly, neuroinflammation is an orchestrated process involving various cell types that may dramatically change their phenotypic and functional properties upon entering the CNS. Recent advances in single-cell multiomics offer the unique opportunity to resolve this cellular heterogeneity in a holistic fashion and reshape our understanding of the molecular and cellular processes during neuroinflammation. Here, we provide an overview of technical advances in single-cell multiomics and the tremendous impact on our basic understanding of neuroinflammation. We discuss insights obtained in neuroinflammatory diseases and elaborate to which extent these tool sets could be applied in a clinical setting.

For example, the challenge of sparsity in single-omics data might be partly resolved by compensating for missing information across modalities. In particular, deep learning approaches, such as deep generative models (DGMs), can potentially uncover complex patterns via a joint embedding. Yet, this also raises the question of sample size requirements for identifying such patterns from single-cell multi-omics data. Here, we empirically examine the quality of DGM-based integrations for varying sample sizes. We first review the existing literature and give a short overview of deep learning methods for multi-omics integration. Next, we consider eight popular tools in more detail and examine their robustness to different cell numbers, covering two of the most common multi-omics types currently favored. Specifically, we use data featuring simultaneous gene expression measurements at the RNA level and protein abundance measurements for cell surface proteins (CITE-seq), as well as data where chromatin accessibility and RNA expression are measured in thousands of cells (10x Multiome). We examine the ability of the methods to learn joint embeddings based on biological and technical metrics. Finally, we provide recommendations for the design of multi-omics experiments and discuss potential future developments.

However, detection of mutations in single cells remains technically challenging. Here, we describe SComatic, an algorithm designed for the detection of somatic mutations in single-cell transcriptomic and ATAC-seq data sets without requiring matched bulk or single-cell DNA sequencing data. Using >1.5M single cells from 383 single-cell RNAseq and single-cell ATAC-seq data sets spanning cancer and non-neoplastic samples, we show that SComatic detects mutations in single cells, even in differentiated cells from polyclonal tissues not amenable to mutation detection using existing methods. In addition, SComatic permits the estimation of mutational burdens and de novo mutational signature analysis at single-cell and cell-type resolution. Notably, using matched exome and single-cell RNAseq data, we show that SComatic achieves a 20 to 40-fold increase in precision as compared to existing algorithms for somatic SNV calling without compromising sensitivity. Overall, SComatic opens the possibility to study somatic mutagenesis at unprecedented resolution using high-throughput single-cell profiling data sets.

Although previous studies reported the profiles of the retinal cell types as the transcriptome level, there is no study regarding the open-chromatin profiles at a similar resolution. Here, we generated and integrated a multi-omics single-cell atlas of the adult human retina, including over 250K nuclei for single-nuclei RNA-seq and 137K nuclei for single-nuclei ATAC-seq. Through enrichment of rare cell types, this single cell multiome atlas is more comprehensive than previous human retina studies. Cross species comparison of the retina atlas among human, monkey, mice, and chicken revealed relatively conserved and non-conserved types. Interestingly, the overall cell heterogeneity in primate retina decreases compared to that of rodent and chicken retina. Furthermore, integrative analysis of the single cell multi-omics data identified 35k distal cis-element-gene pairs with most of these cis-elements being cell type specific. We also showed that the cis-element-gene relationship in different cell types within the same class could be highly heterogenous. Moreover, we constructed transcription factor (TF)-target regulons for over 200 TFs, partitioned the TFs into distinct co-active modules, and annotated each module based on their cell-type specificity. Taken together, we present the most comprehensive single-cell multi-omics atlas of the human retina as a valuable resource that enables systematic in-depth molecular characterization at individual cell type resolution.

Despite this advance, analysis of the resulting data is challenging, and large scale scATAC-seq data are difficult to obtain and expensive to generate. This motivates a method to leverage information from previously generated large scale scATAC-seq or scRNA-seq data to guide our analysis of new scATAC-seq datasets. We analyze scATAC-seq data using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a Bayesian algorithm that was developed to model text corpora, summarizing documents as mixtures of topics defined based on the words that distinguish the documents. When applied to scATAC-seq, LDA treats cells as documents and their accessible sites as words, identifying “topics” based on the cell type-specific accessible sites in those cells. Previous work used uniform symmetric priors in LDA, but we hypothesized that nonuniform matrix priors generated from LDA models trained on existing data sets may enable improved detection of cell types in new data sets, especially if they have relatively few cells. In this work, we test this hypothesis in scATAC-seq data from whole C. elegans nematodes and SHARE-seq data from mouse skin cells. We show that nonsymmetric matrix priors for LDA improve our ability to capture cell type information from small scATAC-seq datasets.

Here, we propose a novel computational method scAB, which integrates single-cell genomics data with clinically annotated bulk sequencing data via a knowledge- and graph-guided matrix factorization model. Once combined, scAB provides a coarse- and fine-grain multiresolution perspective of phenotype-associated cell states and prognostic signatures previously not visible by single-cell genomics. We use scAB to enhance live cancer single-cell RNA-seq data, identifying clinically-relevant previously unrecognized cancer and stromal cell subsets whose signatures show a stronger poor-survival association. The identified fine-grain cell subsets are associated with distinct cancer hallmarks and prognosis power. Furthermore, scAB demonstrates its utility as a biomarker identification tool, with the ability to predict immunotherapy, drug responses and survival when applied to melanoma single-cell RNA-seq datasets and glioma single-cell ATAC-seq datasets. Across multiple single-cell and bulk datasets from different cancer types, we also demonstrate the superior performance of scAB in generating prognosis signatures and survival predictions over existing models. Overall, scAB provides an efficient tool for prioritizing clinically-relevant cell subsets and predictive signatures, utilizing large publicly available databases to improve prognosis and treatments.

To date, most male breast cancers (MBC) are treated according to protocols established for female breast cancer (FBC). Thus, defining the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of MBC with improved resolution is critical for developing better avenues for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we present matched transcriptional (scRNA-seq) and epigenetic (scATAC-seq) profiles at single-cell resolution of two treatment naïve MBC tumors processed immediately after surgical resection. These data enable the detection of differentially expressed genes between male and female breast tumors across immune, stromal, and malignant cell types, to highlight several genes that may have therapeutic implications. Notably, MYC target genes and mTORC1 signaling genes were significantly upregulated in the malignant cells of MBC compared to the female counterparts. To understand how the regulatory landscape of MBC give rise to these male-specific gene expression patterns, we leveraged the scATAC-seq data to systematically link changes in chromatin accessibility to changes in gene expression within each cell type. We observed cancer-specific rewiring of several salient enhancers and posit that these enhancers have a higher regulatory load than lineage specific enhancers. We highlight two examples of previously unannotated cancer-cell specific enhancers of ANXA2 and PRDX4 gene expression and show evidence for super-enhancer regulation of LAMB3 and CD47 in male breast cancer cells. Overall, this dataset annotates clinically relevant regulatory networks in male breast tumors, providing a useful resource that expands our current understanding of the gene expression programs that underlie the biology of MBC.

However, scATAC-seq is challenging to model computationally due to the ultra-high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio, complex feature interactions, and high vulnerability to various confounding factors. In this study, we present Translator, an efficient transfer learning approach to capture generalizable chromatin interactions from high-quality (HQ) reference scATAC-seq data to obtain robust cell representations in low-to-moderate quality target scATAC-seq data. We applied Translator on various simulated and real scATAC-seq datasets and demonstrated that Translator could learn more biologically meaningful cell representations than other methods by incorporating information learned from the reference data, thus facilitating various downstream analyses such as clustering and motif enrichment measurements. Moreover, Translator's block-wise deep learning framework can handle nonlinear relationships with restricted connections using fewer parameters to boost computational efficiency through Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) parallelism. Finally, we have implemented Translator as a free software package available for the community to leverage large-scale, HQ reference data to study target scATAC-seq data.

Dynamic reorganizations of TADs between health and disease states are associated with transcription and other essential genome functions. However, computational methods that can identify reorganized TADs are still in the early stages of development. Here, we present DiffDomain, an algorithm leveraging high-dimensional random matrix theory to identify structurally reorganized TADs using chromatin contact maps. Method comparison using multiple real Hi-C datasets reveals that DiffDomain outperforms alternative methods for FPRs, TPRs, and identifying a new subtype of reorganized TADs. The robustness of DiffDomain and its biological applications are demonstrated by applying on Hi-C data from different cell types and disease states. Identified reorganized TADs are associated with structural variations and changes in CTCF binding sites and other epigenomic changes. By applying to a single-cell Hi-C data from mouse neuronal development, DiffDomain can identify reorganized TADs between cell types with reasonable reproducibility using pseudo-bulk Hi-C data from as few as 100 cells per condition. Moreover, DiffDomain reveals that TADs have clear differential cell-to-population variability and heterogeneous cell-to-cell variability. Therefore, DiffDomain is a statistically sound method for better comparative analysis of TADs using both Hi-C and single-cell Hi-C data.

Although single-cell omics have provided molecular characterization of cell types and states on diverse tissue samples, their genetic ancestry and effects on cellular molecular traits are largely understudied. Here, we developed Monopogen, a computational tool enabling researchers to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from a variety of single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing data. It leverages linkage disequilibrium from external reference panels to identify germline SNVs from sparse sequencing data and uses Monovar to identify novel SNVs at cluster (or cell type) levels. Monopogen can identify 100K~3M germline SNVs from various single cell sequencing platforms (scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq etc), with genotyping accuracy higher than 95%, when compared against matched whole genome sequencing data. We applied Monopogen on human retina, normal breast and Asian immune diversity atlases, showing that that derived genotypes enable accurate global and local ancestry inference and identification of admixed samples from ancestrally diverse donors. In addition, we applied Monopogen on ~4M cells from 65 human heart left ventricle single cell samples and identified novel variants associated with cardiomyocyte metabolic levels and epigenomic programs. In summary, Monopogen provides a novel computational framework that brings together population genetics and single cell omics to uncover genetic determinants of cellular quantitative traits.	numpy, pandas, pillow, pysam, scipy	Samtools, GATK	Monopogen: single nucleotide variant calling from single cell sequencing	11.16006136	8.096153681	6.40762343	10.1101/2022.12.04.519058	2	Dou J, Tan Y, Kok k, Wang J, Cheng X, Tan L, Han K, Hon C, Park W, Shin J, Chen H, Prabhakar S, Navin N, Chen R, Chen K.

Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments10 de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the ‘regulome’.

However, single-cell characterization of the epigenome has remained challenging. Furthermore, because cells must be physically separated before biochemical processing, conventional single-cell preparatory methods scale linearly. We applied combinatorial cellular indexing to measure chromatin accessibility in thousands of single cells per assay, circumventing the need for compartmentalization of individual cells. We report chromatin accessibility profiles from more than 15,000 single cells and use these data to cluster cells on the basis of chromatin accessibility landscapes. We identify modules of coordinately regulated chromatin accessibility at the level of single cells both between and within cell types, with a scalable method that may accelerate progress toward a human cell atlas.

Recent advances have allowed paired capture of protein abundance and transcriptomic state, but a lack of epigenetic information in these assays has left a missing link to gene regulation. Using the heterogeneous mixture of cells in human peripheral blood as a test case, we developed a novel scATAC-seq workflow that increases signal-to-noise and allows paired measurement of cell surface markers and chromatin accessibility: integrated cellular indexing of chromatin landscape and epitopes, called ICICLE-seq. We extended this approach using a droplet-based multiomics platform to develop a trimodal assay that simultaneously measures transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), epitopes, and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) from thousands of single cells, which we term TEA-seq. Together, these multimodal single-cell assays provide a novel toolkit to identify type-specific gene regulation and expression grounded in phenotypically defined cell types.

We applied Perturb-ATAC to transcription factors (TFs), chromatin-modifying factors, and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in ∼4,300 single cells, encompassing more than 63 genotype-phenotype relationships. Perturb-ATAC in human B lymphocytes uncovered regulators of chromatin accessibility, TF occupancy, and nucleosome positioning and identified a hierarchy of TFs that govern B cell state, variation, and disease-associated cis-regulatory elements. Perturb-ATAC in primary human epidermal cells revealed three sequential modules of cis-elements that specify keratinocyte fate. Combinatorial deletion of all pairs of these TFs uncovered their epistatic relationships and highlighted genomic co-localization as a basis for synergistic interactions. Thus, Perturb-ATAC is a powerful strategy to dissect gene regulatory networks in development and disease.

Conventional DNase sequencing (DNase-seq) for genome-wide DHSs profiling is limited by the requirement of millions of cells4,5. Here we report an ultrasensitive strategy, called single-cell DNase sequencing (scDNase-seq) for detection of genome-wide DHSs in single cells. We show that DHS patterns at the single-cell level are highly reproducible among individual cells. Among different single cells, highly expressed gene promoters and enhancers associated with multiple active histone modifications display constitutive DHS whereas chromatin regions with fewer histone modifications exhibit high variation of DHS. Furthermore, the single-cell DHSs predict enhancers that regulate cell-specific gene expression programs and the cell-to-cell variations of DHS are predictive of gene expression. Finally, we apply scDNase-seq to pools of tumour cells and pools of normal cells, dissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides from patients with thyroid cancer, and detect thousands of tumour-specific DHSs. Many of these DHSs are associated with promoters and enhancers critically involved in cancer development. Analysis of the DHS sequences uncovers one mutation (chr18: 52417839G>C) in the tumour cells of a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma, which affects the binding of the tumour suppressor protein p53 and correlates with decreased expression of its target gene TXNL1. In conclusion, scDNase-seq can reliably detect DHSs in single cells, greatly extending the range of applications of DHS analysis both for basic and for translational research, and may provide critical information for personalized medicine.

In conjunction with DNA transposition, the levels of multiple cell surface or intracellular protein epitopes are recorded by index flow cytometry and positions in arrayed microwells, and then subject to molecular barcoding for subsequent pooled analysis. Pi-ATAC simultaneously identifies the epigenomic and proteomic heterogeneity in individual cells. Pi-ATAC reveals a casual link between transcription factor abundance and DNA motif access, and deconvolute cell types and states in the tumor microenvironment in vivo.

Here we combined sequencing of the TCR-encoding genes with assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) analysis at the single-cell level to provide information on the TCR specificity and epigenomic state of individual T cells. By using this approach, termed transcript-indexed ATAC-seq (T-ATAC-seq), we identified epigenomic signatures in immortalized leukemic T cells, primary human T cells from healthy volunteers and primary leukemic T cells from patient samples. In peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from healthy individuals, we identified cis and trans regulators of naive and memory T cell states and found substantial heterogeneity in surface-marker-defined T cell populations. In patients with a leukemic form of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, T-ATAC-seq enabled identification of leukemic and nonleukemic regulatory pathways in T cells from the same individual by allowing separation of the signals that arose from the malignant clone from the background T cell noise. Thus, T-ATAC-seq is a new tool that enables analysis of epigenomic landscapes in clonal T cells and should be valuable for studies of T cell malignancy, immunity and immunotherapy.

In human myelogenous leukemia cells, we apply CRISPR–sciATAC to target 105 chromatin-related genes, generating chromatin accessibility data for ~30,000 single cells. We correlate the loss of specific chromatin remodelers with changes in accessibility globally and at the binding sites of individual transcription factors (TFs). For example, we show that loss of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 increases accessibility at heterochromatic regions involved in embryonic development and triggers expression of genes in the HOXA and HOXD clusters. At a subset of regulatory sites, we also analyze changes in nucleosome spacing following the loss of chromatin remodelers.

Applying spatial-ATAC-seq to tonsil tissue resolved the spatially distinct organization of immune cell types and states in lymphoid follicles and extrafollicular zones.

To this end, we generated matched scRNA- and scATAC-seq profiles of human scalp biopsies, identifying diverse cell types of the hair follicle niche. By interrogating the integrated datasets across multiple levels of cellular resolution, we infer 50-100% more enhancer-gene links than prior approaches, and show that the aggregate accessibility at linked enhancers for highly-regulated genes predicts expression. We use these gene-regulatory maps to prioritize cell types, genes, and causal variants implicated in the pathobiology of androgenetic alopecia (AGA), eczema, and other complex traits. AGA GWAS signals are strongly and specifically enriched in dermal papilla cell open chromatin regions, supporting the role of these cells as key drivers of AGA pathogenesis. Finally, we trained machine-learning models to nominate SNPs that affect gene expression through disruption of specific transcription factor binding motifs, identifying candidate functional SNPs linked to expression of WNT10A in AGA and IL18RAP in eczema.

We identified and validated disease-specific cardiac cell states of major cell types and analysed them in their spatial context, evaluating their dependency on other cell types. Our data elucidate the molecular principles of human myocardial tissue organization, recapitulating a gradual cardiomyocyte and myeloid continuum following ischaemic injury.

We identified elements in smooth muscle cell transition states (for example, fibromyocytes) and functional variants predicted to alter smooth muscle cell- and macrophage-specific regulation of MRAS (3q22) and LIPA (10q23), respectively. We further nominated key driver transcription factors such as PRDM16 and TBX2. Together, this single-nucleus atlas provides a critical step towards interpreting regulatory mechanisms across the continuum of CAD risk.

In this pilot study, using 10x Genomics Chromium and Visium platform, we performed an integrative analysis of spatial transcriptome with single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq on lung cells from mice after immunization using a well-established Klebsiella pneumoniae infection model. We built an optimized deconvolution pipeline to accurately decipher specific cell-type compositions by anatomic location. We discovered that combining scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data may provide more robust cell-type identification, especially for lineage-specific T helper cells. Combining all three modalities, we observed a dynamic change in the location of T helper cells as well as their corresponding chemokines. In summary, our proof-of-principle study demonstrated the power and potential of single-cell multi-omics analysis to uncover spatial- and cell-type-dependent mechanisms of lung immunity.

To establish the organ's delicate function during development and differentiation, spatiotemporal gene expression is strictly controlled by chromatin accessibility and cell type–specific transcription factors, jointly representing the regulatory landscape. Bulk sequencing technology and cellular heterogeneity obscured investigations on the interplay between transcription factors and chromatin accessibility in inner ear development. To study the formation of the regulatory landscape in hair cells, we collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles accompanied by single-cell RNA data from genetically labeled murine hair cells and supporting cells after birth. Using an integrative approach, we predicted cell type–specific activating and repressing functions of developmental transcription factors. Furthermore, by integrating gene expression and chromatin accessibility data sets, we reconstructed gene regulatory networks. Then, using a comparative approach, 20 hair cell–specific activators and repressors, including putative downstream target genes, were identified. Clustering of target genes resolved groups of related transcription factors and was used to infer their developmental functions. Finally, the heterogeneity in the single-cell data allowed us to spatially reconstruct transcriptional as well as chromatin accessibility trajectories, indicating that gradual changes in the chromatin accessibility landscape are lagging behind the transcriptional identity of hair cells along the organ's longitudinal axis. Overall, this study provides a strategy to spatially reconstruct the formation of a lineage-specific regulatory landscape using a single-cell multi-omics approach.

Biological function relies, however, on emergent processes in the three-dimensional space of the nucleus, such as droplet formation through phase separation. Here, we use single-cell multi-omics sequencing to develop a theoretical framework to rigorously map epigenome profiling along the DNA sequence onto a description of the emergent spatial dynamics in the nucleus. Drawing on scNMT-seq multi-omics sequencing in vitro and in vivo we exemplify our approach in the context of exit from pluripotency and global de novo methylation of the genome. We show how DNA methylation patterns of the embryonic genome are established through the interplay between spatially correlated DNA methylation and topological changes to the DNA. This feedback leads to the predicted formation of 30-40nm sized condensates of methylated DNA and determines genome-scale DNA methylation rates. We verify these findings with orthogonal single cell multi-omics data that combine the methylome with HiC measurements. Notably, this scale of chromatin organization has recently been described by super-resolution microscopy. Using this framework, we identify local methylation correlations in gene bodies that precede transcriptional changes at the exit from pluripotency. Our work provides a general framework of how mechanistic insights into emergent processes underlying cell fate decisions can be gained by the combination of single-cell multi-omics and methods from theoretical physics that have not been applied in the context of genomics before.

We performed single nucleus ATAC (snATAC-seq) and RNA (snRNA-seq) sequencing to generate paired, cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility and transcriptional profiles of the adult human kidney. We demonstrate that snATAC-seq is comparable to snRNA-seq in the assignment of cell identity and can further refine our understanding of functional heterogeneity in the nephron. The majority of differentially accessible chromatin regions are localized to promoters and a significant proportion are closely associated with differentially expressed genes. Cell-type-specific enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs implicates the activation of NF-κB that promotes VCAM1 expression and drives transition between a subpopulation of proximal tubule epithelial cells. Our multi-omics approach improves the ability to detect unique cell states within the kidney and redefines cellular heterogeneity in the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb.

Aiming to understand the tissue composition of cell types, their gene expression and global gene regulation in the development of NAFLD, we performed single-nucleus and bulk ATAC-seq on the liver of rats fed with a high-fat diet (HFD). Methods: Male Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats were fed a normal diet or a HFD. Rats fed HFD for 4 weeks developed fatty liver, and those fed HFD for 8 weeks further developed steatohepatitis. Under the washout condition, where 4 weeks of HFD is followed by 4 weeks of a normal diet, fatty liver was partially ameliorated. For each dietary condition, we performed single-nucleus ATAC-seq on one animal and bulk ATAC-seq on four animals. Results: In accordance with the pathological progression from fatty liver to steatohepatitis, the proportion of inflammatory macrophages dramatically increased. By machine learning, we divided the global gene expression into modules, such that transcription factors in a module regulate the genes in the same module. Consequently, many of the modules rediscovered known regulatory relationship between the transcription factors and biological processes. For the discovered biological processes, we searched core genes, which were defined as genes central regarding co-expression and protein-protein interaction. A large part of the core genes overlapped with previously implicated NAFLD genes. Conclusions: Single-nucleus ATAC-seq combined with data-driven statistical analysis help elucidate the global gene regulation in vivo as a combination of modules and discover core genes of the relevant biological processes.

However, how molecular programs within individual cell types vary across individuals by age and sex remains poorly characterized. To better understand this variation, we performed single-nucleus combinatorial indexing (sci) ATAC- and RNA-Seq in human heart samples from nine donors. We identify hundreds of differentially expressed genes by age and sex. Sex dependent alterations include pathways such as TGFβ signaling and metabolic shifts by sex, evident in both transcriptional alterations and differing presence of transcription factor (TF) motifs in accessible chromatin. Age was associated with changes such as immune activation-related transcriptional and chromatin accessibility differences, as well as changes in the relative proportion of cardiomyocytes, neurons, and perivascular cells. In addition, we compare our adult-derived ATAC-Seq profiles to analogous fetal cell types to identify putative developmental-stage-specific regulatory factors. Finally, we train predictive models of cell-type-specific RNA expression levels utilizing ATAC-Seq profiles to link distal regulatory sequences to promoters, quantifying the predictive value of a simple TF-to-expression regulatory grammar and identifying cell-type-specific TFs.

Cells are classified into separate groups known as cell types by their morphological and biochemical features. Six to several hundreds of spatially ordered cell types are recognized in different animals. This complex organization develops from one cell, a zygote, during ontogeny, and its dynamic equilibrium is often maintained in the adult body. One of the key challenges in biology is to understand the mechanisms that sustain the reproducible development of a complex ordered cell ensemble such as the animal body from a single cell. How cells with identical genomes stably maintain one of the numerous possible phenotypes? How the cell differentiation lineage is selected during development? What genes play a key role in maintaining cell identity, and how do they determine expression of other genes characteristic of the relevant cell type? How does the basically stochastic nature of transcription in an isolated cell affect the stability of cell identity, the selection of a cell lineage, and the variability of cell responses to external stimuli? Better-grounded answers to these questions have become possible with recent progress in single-cell genome-wide analysis techniques, which combine the high throughput of biochemical methods and the differential nature of microscopy. The techniques are still in their infancy, and their further development will certainly revolutionize many fields of life sciences and, in particular, developmental biology.

Here, we apply single-cell chromatin overall omic-scale landscape sequencing (scCOOL-seq) to generate a genome-wide map of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution during human preimplantation development. Unlike in mice, the chromatin of the paternal genome is already more open than that of the maternal genome at the mid-zygote stage in humans, and this state is maintained until the 4-cell stage. After fertilization, genes with high variations in DNA methylation, and those with high variations in chromatin accessibility, tend to be two different sets. Furthermore, 1,797 out of 5,155 (35%) widely open chromatin regions in promoters closed when transcription activity was inhibited, indicating a feedback mechanism between transcription and open chromatin maintenance.

Global epigenetic reprogramming accompanies these changes, but the role of the epigenome in regulating early cell-fate choice remains unresolved, and the coordination between different molecular layers is unclear. Here we describe a single-cell multi-omics map of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression during the onset of gastrulation in mouse embryos. The initial exit from pluripotency coincides with the establishment of a global repressive epigenetic landscape, followed by the emergence of lineage-specific epigenetic patterns during gastrulation. Notably, cells committed to mesoderm and endoderm undergo widespread coordinated epigenetic rearrangements at enhancer marks, driven by ten-eleven translocation (TET)-mediated demethylation and a concomitant increase of accessibility. By contrast, the methylation and accessibility landscape of ectodermal cells is already established in the early epiblast. Hence, regulatory elements associated with each germ layer are either epigenetically primed or remodelled before cell-fate decisions, providing the molecular framework for a hierarchical emergence of the primary germ layers.

Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled the profiling of the gene expression dynamics of these cell fate decisions, yet a comprehensive map of the interplay between transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements is lacking, as are the underlying gene regulatory networks. Here we generate a multi-omics atlas of mouse early organogenesis by simultaneously profiling gene expression and chromatin accessibility from tens of thousands of single cells. We develop a computational method to leverage the multimodal readouts to predict transcription factor binding events in cis-regulatory elements, which we then use to infer gene regulatory networks that underpin lineage commitment events. Finally, we show that these models can be used to generate in silico predictions of the effect of transcription factor perturbations.

Results: We develop a strategy to bridge the gap between measurement and function in single-cell epigenomics. Using single-cell chromatin accessibility and RNA-seq data in K562 leukemic cells, we identify the cell surface marker CD24 as co-varying with chromatin accessibility changes linked to GATA transcription factors in single cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of CD24 high versus low cells prospectively isolated GATA1 and GATA2 high versus low cells. GATA high versus low cells express differential gene regulatory networks, differential sensitivity to the drug imatinib mesylate, and differential self-renewal capacity. Lineage tracing experiments show that GATA/CD24hi cells have the capability to rapidly reconstitute the heterogeneity within the entire starting population, suggesting that GATA expression levels drive a phenotypically relevant source of epigenomic plasticity. Conclusion: Single-cell chromatin accessibility can guide prospective characterization of cancer heterogeneity. Epigenomic subpopulations in cancer impact drug sensitivity and the clonal dynamics of cancer evolution.

Here, we profile open chromatin and gene expression in developing and adult mouse kidneys at single cell resolution. We show critical reliance of gene expression on distal regulatory elements (enhancers). We reveal key cell type-specific transcription factors and major gene-regulatory circuits for kidney cells. Dynamic chromatin and expression changes during nephron progenitor differentiation demonstrates that podocyte commitment occurs early and is associated with sustained Foxl1 expression. Renal tubule cells follow a more complex differentiation, where Hfn4a is associated with proximal and Tfap2b with distal fate. Mapping single nucleotide variants associated with human kidney disease implicates critical cell types, developmental stages, genes, and regulatory mechanisms. The single cell multi-omics atlas reveals key chromatin remodeling events and gene expression dynamics associated with kidney development.

To delineate comprehensive chromatin landscapes during early organogenesis, we mapped chromatin accessibility in 19,453 single nuclei from mouse embryos at 8.25 days post-fertilization. Identification of cell-type-specific regions of open chromatin pinpointed two TAL1-bound endothelial enhancers, which we validated using transgenic mouse assays. Integrated gene expression and transcription factor motif enrichment analyses highlighted cell-type-specific transcriptional regulators. Subsequent in vivo experiments in zebrafish revealed a role for the ETS factor FEV in endothelial identity downstream of ETV2 (Etsrp in zebrafish). Concerted in vivo validation experiments in mouse and zebrafish thus illustrate how single-cell open chromatin maps, representative of a mammalian embryo, provide access to the regulatory blueprint for mammalian organogenesis.	bowtie2, samtools	None	Single-cell chromatin accessibility maps reveal regulatory programs driving early mouse organogenesis	13.61140527	14.04930756	7.364568936	None	10	Pijuan-Sala B, Wilson NK, Xia J, Hou X, Hannah RL, Kinston S, Calero-Nieto FJ, Poirion O, Preissl S, Liu F, Göttgens B.

However, studies of the epigenomic landscape of the developing human brain have yet to be performed at single-cell resolution. Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility of >75,000 cells from eight distinct areas of developing human forebrain using single cell ATAC-seq (scATACseq). We identified thousands of loci that undergo extensive cell type-specific changes in accessibility during corticogenesis. Chromatin state profiling also reveals novel distinctions between neural progenitor cells from different cortical areas not seen in transcriptomic profiles and suggests a role for retinoic acid signaling in cortical arealization. Comparison of the cell type-specific chromatin landscape of cerebral organoids to primary developing cortex found that organoids establish broad cell type-specific enhancer accessibility patterns similar to the developing cortex, but lack many putative regulatory elements identified in homologous primary cell types. Together, our results reveal the important contribution of chromatin state to the emerging patterns of cell type diversity and cell fate specification and provide a blueprint for evaluating the fidelity and robustness of cerebral organoids as a model for cortical development.

Since pancreatic islets are central to type 2 diabetes (T2D), we profiled 15,298 islet cells by using combinatorial barcoding snATAC-seq and identified 12 clusters, including multiple alpha, beta and delta cell states. We cataloged 228,873 accessible chromatin sites and identified transcription factors underlying lineage- and state-specific regulation. We observed state-specific enrichment of fasting glucose and T2D genome-wide association studies for beta cells and enrichment for other endocrine cell types. At T2D signals localized to islet-accessible chromatin, we prioritized variants with predicted regulatory function and co-accessibility with target genes. A causal T2D variant rs231361 at the KCNQ1 locus had predicted effects on a beta cell enhancer co-accessible with INS and genome editing in embryonic stem cell–derived beta cells affected INS levels.

The transcriptional landscapes of human FGC development have been revealed; however, the epigenetic reprogramming process of FGCs remains elusive. Here, we profiled the genome-wide DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility of human FGCs at different phases as well as gonadal niche cells at single-cell resolution. First, we found that DNA methylation levels of FGCs changed in a temporal manner, whereas FGCs at different phases in the same embryo exhibited comparable DNA methylation levels and patterns. Second, we revealed the phase-specific chromatin accessibility signatures at the promoter regions of a large set of critical transcription factors and signaling pathway genes. We also identified potential distal regulatory elements including enhancers in FGCs. Third, compared with other hominid-specific retrotransposons, SVA_D might have a broad spectrum of binding capacity for transcription factors, including SOX15 and SOX17. Finally, using an in vitro culture system of human FGCs, we showed that the BMP signaling pathway promoted the cell proliferation of FGCs, and regulated the WNT signaling pathway by orchestrating the chromatin accessibility of its ligand genes. Our single-cell epigenomic atlas and functional assays provide valuable insights for understanding the strongly heterogeneous, unsynchronized, yet highly robust nature of human germ cell development.

However, asymptomatic infection has also been reported, highlighting the difference in immune responses among individuals. Here we performed single-cell chromatin accessibility and T cell-receptor analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from individuals convalescing from COVID-19 and healthy donors. Chromatin remodelling was observed in both innate and adaptive immune cells in the individuals convalescing from COVID-19. Compared with healthy donors, recovered individuals contained abundant TBET-enriched CD16+ and IRF1-enriched CD14+ monocytes with sequential trained and activated epigenomic states. The B-cell lineage in recovered individuals exhibited an accelerated developmental programme from immature B cells to antibody-producing plasma cells. Finally, an integrated analysis of single-cell T cell-receptor clonality with the chromatin accessibility landscape revealed the expansion of putative SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells with epigenomic profiles that promote the differentiation of effector or memory cells. Overall, our data suggest that immune cells of individuals convalescing from COVID-19 exhibit global remodelling of the chromatin accessibility landscape, indicative of the establishment of immunological memory.

Here, we comprehensively characterize mouse cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) marked by Nkx2-5 and Isl1 expression from E7.5 to E9.5 using single-cell RNA sequencing and transposase-accessible chromatin profiling (ATAC-seq). By leveraging on cell-to-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility heterogeneity, we identify different previously unknown cardiac subpopulations. Reconstruction of developmental trajectories reveal that multipotent Isl1+ CPC pass through an attractor state before separating into different developmental branches, whereas extended expression of Nkx2-5 commits CPC to an unidirectional cardiomyocyte fate. Furthermore, we show that CPC fate transitions are associated with distinct open chromatin states critically depending on Isl1 and Nkx2-5.

Here we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) to over 8,000 human immunophenotypic blood cells from fetal liver and bone marrow. We inferred their differentiation trajectory and identified three highly proliferative oligopotent progenitor populations downstream of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)/multipotent progenitors (MPPs). Along this trajectory, we observed opposing patterns of chromatin accessibility and differentiation that coincided with dynamic changes in the activity of distinct lineage-specific transcription factors. Integrative analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene expression revealed extensive epigenetic but not transcriptional priming of HSCs/MPPs prior to their lineage commitment. Finally, we refined and functionally validated the sorting strategy for the HSCs/MPPs and achieved around 90% enrichment. Our study provides a useful framework for future investigation of human developmental hematopoiesis in the context of blood pathologies and regenerative medicine.

Recent studies employing single cell RNA-sequencing have identified major transcriptional changes associated with germ layer specification. Global epigenetic reprogramming accompanies these changes, but the role of the epigenome in regulating early cell fate choice remains unresolved, and the coordination between different epigenetic layers is unclear. Here we describe the first single cell triple-omics map of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression during the exit from pluripotency and the onset of gastrulation in mouse embryos. We find dynamic dependencies between the different molecular layers, with evidence for distinct modes of epigenetic regulation. The initial exit from pluripotency coincides with the establishment of a global repressive epigenetic landscape, followed by the emergence of local lineage-specific epigenetic patterns during gastrulation. Notably, cells committed to mesoderm and endoderm undergo widespread coordinated epigenetic rearrangements, driven by loss of methylation in enhancer marks and a concomitant increase of chromatin accessibility. In striking contrast, the epigenetic landscape of ectodermal cells is already established in the early epiblast. Hence, regulatory elements associated with each germ layer are either epigenetically primed or epigenetically remodelled prior to overt cell fate decisions during gastrulation, providing the molecular logic for a hierarchical emergence of the primary germ layers.

Single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles of murine and human tissue Treg cells defined a conserved, microbiota-independent tissue-repair Treg signature with a prevailing footprint of the transcription factor BATF. This signature, combined with gene expression profiling and TCR fate mapping, identified a population of tissue-like Treg cells in human peripheral blood that expressed BATF, chemokine receptor CCR8 and HLA-DR. Human BATF+CCR8+ Treg cells from normal skin and adipose tissue shared features with nonlymphoid T follicular helper-like (Tfh-like) cells, and induction of a Tfh-like differentiation program in naive human Treg cells partially recapitulated tissue Treg regenerative characteristics, including wound healing potential.

In the developing brain, cell fate specification and topographic identity are important for defining cell identity2 and confer selective vulnerabilities to neurodevelopmental disorders3. Here, to identify cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility patterns in the developing human brain, we used a single-cell assay for transposase accessibility by sequencing (scATAC-seq) in primary tissue samples from the human forebrain. We applied unbiased analyses to identify genomic loci that undergo extensive cell-type- and brain-region-specific changes in accessibility during neurogenesis, and an integrative analysis to predict cell-type-specific candidate regulatory elements. We found that cerebral organoids recapitulate most putative cell-type-specific enhancer accessibility patterns but lack many cell-type-specific open chromatin regions that are found in vivo. Systematic comparison of chromatin accessibility across brain regions revealed unexpected diversity among neural progenitor cells in the cerebral cortex and implicated retinoic acid signalling in the specification of neuronal lineage identity in the prefrontal cortex. Together, our results reveal the important contribution of chromatin state to the emerging patterns of cell type diversity and cell fate specification and provide a blueprint for evaluating the fidelity and robustness of cerebral organoids as a model for cortical development.

Patient survival varies and no effective therapies for advanced pRCC exist. Histological and molecular characterization studies have highlighted the heterogeneity of pRCC tumours. Recent studies identified the proximal tubule (PT) cell as a cell-of-origin for pRCC. However, it remains elusive whether other pRCC subtypes have different cell-of-origin. Here, by obtaining genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles of normal human kidney cells using single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin-sequencing and comparing the profiles with pRCC samples, we discover that besides PT cells, pRCC can also originate from kidney collecting duct principal cells. We show pRCCs with different cell-of-origin exhibit different molecular characteristics and clinical behaviors. Further, metabolic reprogramming appears to mediate the progression of pRCC to the advanced state. Here, our results suggest that determining cell-of-origin and monitoring origin-dependent metabolism could potentially be useful for early diagnosis and treatment of pRCC.

We introduce a regression-based approach to infer cell types by comparing transcription start site–distal ATAC-seq peaks to reference enhancer maps and show consistency with RNA-based marker gene cell type assignments. We find heterogeneity in enrichment of genetic variants linked to complex phenotypes from the UK Biobank and diabetes genome-wide association studies in cell-specific ATAC-seq peaks, with the most striking enrichment patterns in muscle mesenchymal stem cells (∼3.5% of nuclei). Finally, we overlay these chromatin accessibility maps on GWAS data to nominate causal cell types, SNPs, transcription factor motifs, and target genes for type 2 diabetes signals. These chromatin accessibility profiles for human and rat skeletal muscle cell types are a useful resource for nominating causal GWAS SNPs and cell types.

Many of these loci are enriched in cisregulatory elements but not linked to cardiometabolic risk factors nor to candidate causal genes, complicating their functional interpretation. Objective: Single-nucleus chromatin accessibility profiling of the human atherosclerotic lesions was used to investigate cell type–specific patterns of cisregulatory elements, to understand transcription factors establishing cell identity, and to interpret CAD-relevant, noncoding genetic variation. Methods and Results: We used single-nucleus ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing) to generate DNA accessibility maps in >7000 cells derived from human atherosclerotic lesions. We identified 5 major lesional cell types including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, monocyte/macrophages, natural killer/T cells, and B cells and further investigated subtype characteristics of macrophages and smooth muscle cells transitioning into fibromyocytes. We demonstrated that CAD-associated genetic variants are particularly enriched in endothelial and smooth muscle cell–specific open chromatin. Using single-cell coaccessibility and cis–expression quantitative trait loci information, we prioritized putative target genes and candidate regulatory elements for ≈30% of all known CAD loci. Finally, we performed genome-wide experimental fine-mapping of the CAD variants identified in genome-wide association studies using epigenetic quantitative trait loci analysis in primary human aortic endothelial cells and self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-Seq) massively parallel reporter assay in smooth muscle cells. This analysis identified potential causal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the associated target gene for over 30 CAD loci. We present several examples where the chromatin accessibility and gene expression could be assigned to one cell type predicting the cell type of action for CAD loci. Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential of applying single-nucleus ATAC-seq to human tissues in revealing relative contributions of distinct cell types to diseases and in identifying genes likely to be influenced by noncoding genome-wide association study variants.

Translating these risk variants into mechanistic insights requires detailed maps of gene regulation in disease-relevant cell types2. Here we combined two approaches: a genome-wide association study of type 1 diabetes (T1D) using 520,580 samples, and the identification of candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in pancreas and peripheral blood mononuclear cells using single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC–seq) of 131,554 nuclei. Risk variants for T1D were enriched in cCREs that were active in T cells and other cell types, including acinar and ductal cells of the exocrine pancreas. Risk variants at multiple T1D signals overlapped with exocrine-specific cCREs that were linked to genes with exocrine-specific expression. At the CFTR locus, the T1D risk variant rs7795896 mapped to a ductal-specific cCRE that regulated CFTR; the risk allele reduced transcription factor binding, enhancer activity and CFTR expression in ductal cells. These findings support a role for the exocrine pancreas in the pathogenesis of T1D and highlight the power of large-scale genome-wide association studies and single-cell epigenomics for understanding the cellular origins of complex disease.	bwa, MACS2, samtools, bedtools, picard, pysam, scanpy, Harmony	None	Interpreting type 1 diabetes risk with genetics and single-cell epigenomics	57.13822845	34.78489409	11.70952032	None	9	Chiou J, Geusz RJ, Okino ML, Han JY, Miller M, Melton R, Beebe E, Benaglio P, Huang S, Korgaonkar K, Heller S.

Here, we acquire single-cell transcriptomes and accessible chromatin profiles during in vitro islet differentiation and pancreas from childhood and adult donors for comparison. We delineate major cell types, define their regulomes, and describe spatiotemporal gene regulatory relationships between transcription factors. CDX2 emerged as a regulator of enterochromaffin-like cells, which we show resemble a transient, previously unrecognized, CDX2+ pre-β-cell population in fetal pancreas, arguing against a proposed non-pancreatic origin. Furthermore, we observe insufficient activation of signal-dependent transcriptional programs during in vitro β-cell maturation and identify sex hormones as drivers of β-cell proliferation in childhood. Altogether, our analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of cell fate acquisition in stem cell-derived islets and a framework for manipulating cell identities and maturity.

Here, we show that ~13–21% of cell barcodes from the 10x Chromium scATAC-seq assay may have been derived from a droplet with more than one oligonucleotide sequence, which we call “barcode multiplets”. We demonstrate that barcode multiplets can be derived from at least two different sources. First, we confirm that approximately 4% of droplets from the 10x platform may contain multiple beads. Additionally, we find that approximately 5% of beads may contain detectable levels of multiple oligonucleotide barcodes. We show that this artifact can confound single-cell analyses, including the interpretation of clonal diversity and proliferation of intra-tumor lymphocytes. Overall, our work provides a conceptual and computational framework to identify and assess the impacts of barcode multiplets in single-cell data.	pysam, biopython	None	Inference and effects of barcode multiplets in droplet-based single-cell assays	32.74228286	19.63183012	6.361862437	None	2	Lareau CA, Ma S, Duarte FM, Buenrostro JD.

To address this knowledge gap, we probed chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution in the brains, hearts, skeletal muscles, and bone marrows from young, middle-aged, and old mice, and assessed age-associated changes at 353,126 candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) across 32 major cell types. Unexpectedly, we detected increased chromatin accessibility within specific heterochromatin domains in old mouse excitatory neurons. The gain of chromatin accessibility at these genomic loci was accompanied by the cell-type-specific loss of heterochromatin and activation of LINE1 elements. Immunostaining further confirmed the loss of the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 in the excitatory neurons but not in inhibitory neurons or glial cells. Our results reveal the cell-type-specific changes in chromatin landscapes in old mice and shed light on the scope of heterochromatin loss in mammalian aging.

To drive stable and precise gene transcription that is robust to genetic variation and environmental stress, genes are often targeted by multiple enhancers with redundant action. However, it is unknown whether enhancers targeting the same gene display simultaneous activity or whether some enhancer combinations are more often co-active than others. Here, we take advantage of the recent developments in single cell technology that permit assessing chromatin status (scATAC-seq) and gene expression (scRNA-seq) in the same single cells to link gene expression to the activity of multiple enhancers. Measuring activity patterns across 24,844 human lymphoblastoid single cells, we found that the majority of enhancers associated with the same gene display significant correlation in their chromatin profiles. For 6944 expressed genes associated with enhancers, we identified 89,885 significant enhancer-enhancer associations between nearby enhancers. We found that associated enhancers share similar transcription factor binding profiles and that gene essentiality is linked with higher enhancer co-activity. Our extensive enhancer co-activity maps can be used to pinpoint combinations of enhancers relevant in gene expression regulation and allow us to better predict the effect of genetic variation falling in non-coding regions.

Single-cell measurement of chromatin accessibility (DNA), gene expression (RNA), and proteins has revealed rich cellular diversity across tissues, organisms, and disease states. However, single-cell data poses a unique set of challenges. A dataset may comprise millions of cells with tens of thousands of sparse features. Identifying biologically relevant signals from the background sources of technical noise requires innovation in predictive and representational learning. Furthermore, unlike in machine vision or natural language processing, biological ground truth is limited. Here we leverage recent advances in multi-modal single-cell technologies which, by simultaneously measuring two layers of cellular processing in each cell, provide ground truth analogous to language translation. We define three key tasks to predict one modality from another and learn integrated representations of cellular state. We also generate a novel dataset of the human bone marrow specifically designed for benchmarking studies. The dataset and tasks are accessible through an open-source framework that facilitates centralized evaluation of community-submitted methods.

Advances in genomics enable the inference of gene regulatory programs that are active during development. However, this approach cannot capture the complex multicellular interactions that occur during embryogenesis. Compared to model organisms such as fruit flies and zebrafish, the growth of mammalian embryos in utero further complicates the analysis of cell-cell communication during development. However, in vitro models of mammalian development such as gastruloids can overcome this limitation. Using time-resolved single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis, we have delineated the regulatory landscape during gastruloid development and thereby identified the critical drivers of developmental transitions. We observed that gastruloids develop from pluripotent cells driven by the transcription factor (TF) dimer OCT4-SOX2 and differentiate along two main branches. A mesoderm branch characterized by the TF MSGN1 and a spinal cord branch characterized by CDX1, 2, 4 (CDX). Consistent with our lineage reconstruction, ΔCDX gastruloids fail to form spinal cord. Conversely, Msgn1 ablation inhibits the development of paraxial mesoderm, as expected. However, this also abolished spinal cord cells, which is surprising given that MSGN1 is not associated with differentiation along this branch. Therefore, formation of paraxial mesoderm is required for spinal cord development. To validate this, we generated chimeric gastruloids using ΔMSGN1 and wildtype cells, which formed both spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm. Strikingly, ΔMSGN1 cells specifically contributed to spinal cord, suggesting that cell-cell interactions between paraxial mesoderm and spinal cord are necessary for the formation of the latter. Our work has important implications for the study of cell-cell communication in development and how gene regulatory programs are functionally executed to form complex multicellular developmental structures.

Here we calculate 3D structures of entire mammalian genomes using data from a new chromosome conformation capture procedure that allows us to first image and then process single cells. The technique enables genome folding to be examined at a scale of less than 100 kb, and chromosome structures to be validated. The structures of individual topological-associated domains and loops vary substantially from cell to cell. By contrast, A and B compartments, lamina-associated domains and active enhancers and promoters are organized in a consistent way on a genome-wide basis in every cell, suggesting that they could drive chromosome and genome folding. By studying genes regulated by pluripotency factor and nucleosome remodelling deacetylase (NuRD), we illustrate how the determination of single-cell genome structure provides a new approach for investigating biological processes.

Hi-C requires millions of cells as input and, as genome organization varies from cell to cell, a limitation of Hi-C is that it only provides a population average of genome conformations. We developed single-cell Hi-C to create snapshots of thousands of chromatin interactions that occur simultaneously in a single cell. To adapt Hi-C to single-cell analysis, we modified the protocol to include in-nucleus ligation. This enables the isolation of single nuclei carrying Hi-C–ligated DNA into separate tubes, followed by reversal of cross-links, capture of biotinylated ligation junctions on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and PCR amplification of single-cell Hi-C libraries. The entire laboratory protocol can be carried out in 1 week, and although we have demonstrated its use in mouse T helper (TH1) cells, it should be applicable to any cell type or species for which standard Hi-C has been successful. We also developed an analysis pipeline to filter noise and assess the quality of data sets in a few hours.

Hence, although Hi-C is a powerful tool for mapping 3D genome organization, this heterogeneity of chromosome higher order structure among individual cells limits the interpretive power of population based bulk Hi-C assays. Moreover, single-cell studies have the potential to enable the identification and characterization of rare cell populations or cell subtypes in a heterogeneous population. However, it may require surveying relatively large numbers of single cells to achieve statistically meaningful observations in single-cell studies. By applying combinatorial cellular indexing to chromosome conformation capture, we developed single-cell combinatorial indexed Hi-C (sci-Hi-C), a high throughput method that enables mapping chromatin interactomes in large number of single cells.

These single-cell methods, unlike their multi-cell counterparts, allow straightforward computation of realistic chromosome conformations that may be compared and combined with other, independent, techniques to study 3D structure. Here we discuss how single-cell Hi-C and subsequent 3D genome structure determination allows comparison with data from microscopy. We then carry out a systematic evaluation of recently published single-cell Hi-C datasets to establish a computational approach for the evaluation of single-cell Hi-C protocols. We show that the calculation of genome structures provides a useful tool for assessing the quality of single-cell Hi-C data because it requires a self-consistent network of interactions, relating to the underlying 3D conformation, with few errors, as well as sufficient longer-range cis- and trans-chromosomal contacts.

Advanced 3D genome mapping methods that combine proximity ligation and high-throughput sequencing (Hi-C)2 , plus chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIAPET)3 , have revealed topologically associating domains (TADs)4 with frequent chromatin contacts and have identified chromatin loops mediated by specific protein factors for insulation and transcriptional regulation5–7 . However, these methods rely on pairwise proximity ligation and reflect population-level views, and thus cannot reveal the detailed nature of chromatin interactions. Although single-cell Hi-C8 could potentially molecule precision, which has not been possible with previous methods based on population-level pairwise contacts. Applying ChIA-Drop in Drosophila cells reveals that chromatin topological structures are predominantly comprised of multiplex chromatin interactions with high heterogeneity, and that promoter-centered multivalent interactions provide novel topological insights into transcription overcome this issue, it may be limited by data sparsity inherent to current single-cell assays. Recent advances in microfluidics have opened new opportunities for droplet-based genomic analysis9 , yet this approach has not been adapted to chromatin interaction analysis.

Current methods for studying genome-wide structure are based on proximity ligation. However, this approach can fail to detect known structures, such as interactions with nuclear bodies, because these DNA regions can be too far apart to directly ligate. Accordingly, our overall understanding of genome organization remains incomplete. Here, we develop split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension (SPRITE), a method that enables genome-wide detection of higher-order interactions within the nucleus. Using SPRITE, we recapitulate known structures identified by proximity ligation and identify additional interactions occurring across larger distances, including two hubs of inter-chromosomal interactions that are arranged around the nucleolus and nuclear speckles. We show that a substantial fraction of the genome exhibits preferential organization relative to these nuclear bodies. Our results generate a global model whereby nuclear bodies act as inter-chromosomal hubs that shape the overall packaging of DNA in the nucleus.

To address this, we developed 'single-cell split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension' (scSPRITE). scSPRITE uses split-and-pool barcoding to tag DNA fragments in the same nucleus and their 3D spatial arrangement. Because scSPRITE measures multiway DNA contacts, it generates higher-resolution maps within an individual cell than can be achieved by proximity ligation. We applied scSPRITE to thousands of mouse embryonic stem cells and detected known genome structures, including chromosome territories, active and inactive compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs) as well as long-range inter-chromosomal structures organized around various nuclear bodies. We observe that these structures exhibit different levels of heterogeneity across the population, with TADs representing dynamic units of genome organization across cells. We expect that scSPRITE will be a critical tool for studying genome structure within heterogeneous populations.

Here we use single-cell Hi-C to study chromosome conformations in thousands of individual cells, and discover a continuum of cis-interaction profiles that finely position individual cells along the cell cycle. We show that chromosomal compartments, topological associated domains (TADs), contact insulation and long-range loops, all defined by bulk Hi-C maps, are governed by distinct cell-cycle dynamics. In particular, DNA replication correlates with build-up of compartments and reduction in TAD insulation, while loops are generally stable from G1 through S and G2. Whole-genome 3D structural models reveal a radial architecture of chromosomal compartments with distinct epigenomic signatures. Our single-cell data thereby allow for re-interpretation of chromosome conformation maps through the prism of the cell cycle.

We report an imaging method for tracing chromatin organization with kilobase- and nanometer-scale resolution, unveiling chromatin conformation across topologically associating domains (TADs) in thousands of individual cells. Our imaging data revealed TAD-like structures with globular conformation and sharp domain boundaries in single cells. The boundaries varied from cell to cell, occurring with nonzero probabilities at all genomic positions but preferentially at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)- and cohesin-binding sites. Notably, cohesin depletion, which abolished TADs at the population-average level, did not diminish TAD-like structures in single cells but eliminated preferential domain boundary positions. Moreover, we observed widespread, cooperative, multiway chromatin interactions, which remained after cohesin depletion. These results provide critical insight into the mechanisms underlying chromatin domain and hub formation.

It is no longer in doubt that the nucleus is spatially compartmentalized and that the genome organization with respect to these compartments is cell type specific. However, it is still unclear if and how this organization contributes to genome function, or whether it is simply a consequence of it. This uncertainty is partly due to the cell-to-cell variability of genome organization, but also due to limitations of the measurement techniques and the scale of the problem at hand.

The observations made with these techniques revealed that topologically associating domains emerge from cell population averages and do not exist as static structures in individual cells. Stochastic nature of the genome folding is likely to be biologically relevant and may reflect the ability of chromatin fibers to adopt a number of alternative configurations, some of which could be transiently stabilized and serve regulatory purposes. Single-cell Hi-C approaches provide an opportunity to analyze chromatin folding in rare cell types such as stem cells, tumor progenitors, oocytes, and totipotent cells, contributing to a deeper understanding of basic mechanisms in development and disease. Here, we review key findings of single-cell Hi-C and discuss possible biological reasons and consequences of the inferred dynamic chromatin spatial organization.

However, differences between cells can be observed only by single-cell measurements that avoid ensemble averaging3,4,5. To study 3D chromatin organization and dynamics before and after fertilization in flowering plants, we analysed the 3D genomes of rice eggs, sperm cells, unicellular zygotes and shoot mesophyll cells. We show that chromatin architectures of rice eggs and sperm cells are comparable to those of mesophyll cells and are reorganized after fertilization. The rice single-cell 3D genomes display specific features of chromosome compartments and telomere/centromere configuration compared to those in mammalian single cells. Active and silent chromatin domains combine to form multiple foci in the nuclear space. Notably, the 3D genomes of the eggs and unicellular zygotes contain a compact silent centre (CSC) that is absent in sperm cells. CSC appears to be reorganized after fertilization, and may be involved in the regulation of zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Our results reveal specific 3D genome features of plant gametes and the unicellular zygote, and provide a spatial chromatin basis for ZGA and epigenetic regulation in plants.

The 3D genome of rod photoreceptors exhibited inverted radial distribution of euchromatin and heterochromatin compared with that of other cell types, whose nuclear periphery is mainly heterochromatin. Such genome-wide inversion is not observed in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). However, OSNs exhibited an interior bias for olfactory receptor (OR) genes and enhancers, in clear contrast to non-neuronal cells. Each OSN harbored multiple aggregates of OR genes and enhancers from different chromosomes. We also observed structural heterogeneity of the protocadherin gene cluster. This type of genome organization may provide the structural basis of the ‘one-neuron, one-receptor’ rule of olfaction.	zlib	None	Three-dimensional genome structures of single sensory neurons in mouse visual and olfactory systems	110.5981283	62.07232471	13.75647971	None	1	Tan L, Xing D, Daley N, Xie XS.

There has been a strong focus on the inference of TF-gene regulatory networks and TF-TF physical interaction networks. Here, we present a third type of TF network, the spatial network of co-localized TF binding sites within the three-dimensional genome. Using published canonical Hi-C data and single-cell genome structures, we assess the spatial proximity of a genome-wide array of potential TF-TF co-localizations in human and mouse cell lines. For individual TFs, the abundance of occupied binding sites shows a positive correspondence with their clustering in three dimensions, and this is especially apparent for weak TF binding sites and at enhancer regions. An analysis between different TF proteins identifies significantly proximal pairs, which are enriched in reported physical interactions. Furthermore, clustering of different TFs based on proximity enrichment identifies two partially segregated co-localization sub-networks, involving different TFs in different cell types. Using data from both human lymphoblastoid cells and mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that these sub-networks are enriched within, but not exclusive to, different chromosome sub-compartments that have been identified previously in Hi-C data. This suggests that the association of TFs within spatial networks is closely coupled to gene regulatory networks. This applies to both differentiated and undifferentiated cells and is a potential causal link between lineage-specific TF binding and chromosome sub-compartment segregation.

The contact first hypothesis states that fusion partners tend to colocalize prior to fusion in normal cells. Here we test this hypothesis at the single-cell level and explore the underlying mechanism. By analyzing published single-cell diploid Hi-C datasets, we find partner genes fused in leukemia exhibit smaller spatial distances than those fused in solid tumor and control gene pairs. Intriguingly, multiple partners tend to colocalize with KMT2A in the same cell. 3D genome architecture has little association with lineage decision of KMT2A fusion types in leukemia. Besides simple translocations, complex rearrangement-related KMT2A fusion genes (CRGs) also show closer proximity and belong to a genome-wide mutual proximity network. We find CRGs are co-expressed, co-localized, and enriched in the targets of the transcriptional factor RUNX1, suggesting they may be involved in RUNX1-mediated transcription factories. Knockdown of RUNX1 leads to significantly fewer contacts among CRGs. We also find CRGs are enriched in active transcriptional regions and loop anchors, and exhibit high levels of TOP2-mediated DNA breakages. Inhibition of transcription leads to reduced DNA breakages of CRGs. Our results demonstrate KMT2A partners and CRGs may form dynamic and multipartite spatial clusters in individual cells that may be involved in RUNX1-mediated transcription factories, wherein massive DNA damages and illegitimate ligations of genes may occur, leading to complex rearrangements and KMT2A fusions in leukemia.

How to characterize pseudo time-series of single cells using single-cell Hi-C maps is an essential and challenging topic. To this end, a powerful circular trajectory reconstruction tool CIRCLET is developed to resolve cell cycle phases of single cells by considering multiscale features of chromosomal architectures without specifying a starting cell. CIRCLET reveals its best superiority based on the combination of one feature set about global information and another two feature sets about local interactional information in terms of designed evaluation indexes and verification strategies from a collection of cell-cycle Hi-C maps of 1171 single cells. Further division of the reconstructed trajectory into 12 stages helps to accurately characterize the dynamics of chromosomal structures and explain the special regulatory events along cell-cycle progression. Last but not the least, the reconstructed trajectory helps to uncover important regulatory genes related with dynamic substructures, providing a novel framework for discovering regulatory regions even cancer markers at single-cell resolution.

Existing techniques for profiling epigenetic marks in single cells often require the use and optimization of time-intensive procedures such as drop fluidics, chromatin fragmentation, and end repair. Here we describe ACT-seq, a streamlined method for mapping genome-wide distributions of histone tail modifications, histone variants, and chromatin-binding proteins in a small number of or single cells. ACT-seq utilizes a fusion of Tn5 transposase to Protein A that is targeted to chromatin by a specific antibody, allowing chromatin fragmentation and sequence tag insertion specifically at genomic sites presenting the relevant antigen. The Tn5 transposase enables the use of an index multiplexing strategy (iACT-seq), which enables construction of thousands of single-cell libraries in one day by a single researcher without the need for drop-based fluidics or visual sorting. We conclude that ACT-seq present an attractive alternative to existing techniques for mapping epigenetic marks in single cells.

A complete understanding of gene regulation will require the mapping of specific chromatin features in small samples of cells at high resolution. Here we describe Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag), an enzyme-tethering strategy that provides efficient high-resolution sequencing libraries for profiling diverse chromatin components. In CUT&Tag, a chromatin protein is bound in situ by a specific antibody, which then tethers a protein A-Tn5 transposase fusion protein. Activation of the transposase efficiently generates fragment libraries with high resolution and exceptionally low background. All steps from live cells to sequencing-ready libraries can be performed in a single tube on the benchtop or a microwell in a high-throughput pipeline, and the entire procedure can be performed in one day. We demonstrate the utility of CUT&Tag by profiling histone modifications, RNA Polymerase II and transcription factors on low cell numbers and single cells.

However, current methods yield ensemble profiles that are insensitive to cell-to-cell variation. Here we combine microfluidics, DNA barcoding and sequencing to collect chromatin data at single-cell resolution. We demonstrate the utility of the technology by assaying thousands of individual cells and using the data to deconvolute a mixture of ES cells, fibroblasts and hematopoietic progenitors into high-quality chromatin state maps for each cell type. The data from each single cell are sparse, comprising on the order of 1,000 unique reads. However, by assaying thousands of ES cells, we identify a spectrum of subpopulations defined by differences in chromatin signatures of pluripotency and differentiation priming. We corroborate these findings by comparison to orthogonal single-cell gene expression data.

Chromatin is implicated in contributing to the cellular heterogeneity in gene expression10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Fully understanding the mechanisms of cellular heterogeneity requires simultaneous measurement of RNA and occupancy of histone modifications and transcription factors on chromatin due to their critical roles in transcriptional regulation17,18. We generally term the occupancy of histone modifications and transcription factors as Chromatin occupancy. Here, we report a technique, termed scPCOR-seq (single-cell Profiling of Chromatin Occupancy and RNAs Sequencing), for simultaneously profiling genome-wide chromatin protein binding or histone modification marks and RNA expression in the same cell. We demonstrated that scPCOR-seq can profile either H3K4me3 or RNAPII and RNAs in a mixture of human H1, GM12878 and 293 T cells at a single-cell resolution and either H3K4me3, RNAPII, or RNA profile can correctly separate the cells. Application of scPCOR-seq to the in vitro differentiation of the erythrocyte precursor CD36 cells from human CD34 stem or progenitor cells revealed that H3K4me3 and RNA exhibit distinct properties in clustering cells during differentiation. Overall, our work provides a promising approach to understand the relationships among different omics layers.

Application of iscChIC-seq to profiling H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in human white blood cells (WBCs) enabled successful detection of more than 10,000 single cells for each histone modification with 11 K and 45 K nonredundant reads per cell, respectively. Cluster analysis of these data allowed identification of monocytes, T cells, B cells, and NK cells from WBCs. The cell types annotated from H3K4me3 single-cell data are specifically correlated with the cell types annotated from H3K27me3 single-cell data. Our data indicate that iscChIC-seq is a reliable technique for profiling histone modifications in a large number of single cells, which may find broad applications in studying cellular heterogeneity and differentiation status in complex developmental and disease systems.

However, the contribution of chromatin features to tumor heterogeneity and evolution remains unknown. Here we describe a high-throughput droplet microfluidics platform to profile chromatin landscapes of thousands of cells at single-cell resolution. Using patient-derived xenograft models of acquired resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy in breast cancer, we found that a subset of cells within untreated drug-sensitive tumors share a common chromatin signature with resistant cells, undetectable using bulk approaches. These cells, and cells from the resistant tumors, have lost chromatin marks—H3K27me3, which is associated with stable transcriptional repression—for genes known to promote resistance to treatment. This single-cell chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing approach paves the way to study the role of chromatin heterogeneity, not just in cancer but in other diseases and healthy systems, notably during cellular differentiation and development.

Here we carry out a comprehensive assessment of the epigenomes of mouse brain cell types by applying single-nucleus DNA methylation sequencing1,2 to profile 103,982 nuclei (including 95,815 neurons and 8,167 non-neuronal cells) from 45 regions of the mouse cortex, hippocampus, striatum, pallidum and olfactory areas. We identified 161 cell clusters with distinct spatial locations and projection targets. We constructed taxonomies of these epigenetic types, annotated with signature genes, regulatory elements and transcription factors. These features indicate the potential regulatory landscape supporting the assignment of putative cell types and reveal repetitive usage of regulators in excitatory and inhibitory cells for determining subtypes. The DNA methylation landscape of excitatory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus varied continuously along spatial gradients. Using this deep dataset, we constructed an artificial neural network model that precisely predicts single neuron cell-type identity and brain area spatial location. Integration of high-resolution DNA methylomes with single-nucleus chromatin accessibility data3 enabled prediction of high-confidence enhancer–gene interactions for all identified cell types, which were subsequently validated by cell-type-specific chromatin conformation capture experiments4. By combining multi-omic datasets (DNA methylation, chromatin contacts, and open chromatin) from single nuclei and annotating the regulatory genome of hundreds of cell types in the mouse brain, our DNA methylation atlas establishes the epigenetic basis for neuronal diversity and spatial organization throughout the mouse cerebrum.

With the proliferation of multi-omics datasets, a major challenge is to validate and integrate results into a biological understanding of cell-type organization. Here we generated transcriptomes and epigenomes from more than 500,000 individual cells in the mouse primary motor cortex, a structure that has an evolutionarily conserved role in locomotion. We developed computational and statistical methods to integrate multimodal data and quantitatively validate cell-type reproducibility. The resulting reference atlas—containing over 56 neuronal cell types that are highly replicable across analysis methods, sequencing technologies and modalities—is a comprehensive molecular and genomic account of the diverse neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in the mouse primary motor cortex. The atlas includes a population of excitatory neurons that resemble pyramidal cells in layer 4 in other cortical regions4. We further discovered thousands of concordant marker genes and gene regulatory elements for these cell types. Our results highlight the complex molecular regulation of cell types in the brain and will directly enable the design of reagents to target specific cell types in the mouse primary motor cortex for functional analysis.

Although recent advances in single-cell genomics have led to high-resolution molecular characterization of cell type diversity in the brain1, neuronal cell types are often studied out of the context of their anatomical properties. To improve our understanding of the relationship between molecular and anatomical features that define cortical neurons, here we combined retrograde labelling with single-nucleus DNA methylation sequencing to link neural epigenomic properties to projections. We examined 11,827 single neocortical neurons from 63 cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical long-distance projections. Our results showed unique epigenetic signatures of projection neurons that correspond to their laminar and regional location and projection patterns. On the basis of their epigenomes, intra-telencephalic cells that project to different cortical targets could be further distinguished, and some layer 5 neurons that project to extra-telencephalic targets (L5 ET) formed separate clusters that aligned with their axonal projections. Such separation varied between cortical areas, which suggests that there are area-specific differences in L5 ET subtypes, which were further validated by anatomical studies. Notably, a population of cortico-cortical projection neurons clustered with L5 ET rather than intra-telencephalic neurons, which suggests that a population of L5 ET cortical neurons projects to both targets. We verified the existence of these neurons by dual retrograde labelling and anterograde tracing of cortico-cortical projection neurons, which revealed axon terminals in extra-telencephalic targets including the thalamus, superior colliculus and pons. These findings highlight the power of single-cell epigenomic approaches to connect the molecular properties of neurons with their anatomical and projection properties.

Here, using high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of more than 450,000 single nuclei in humans, marmoset monkeys and mice, we demonstrate a broadly conserved cellular makeup of this region, with similarities that mirror evolutionary distance and are consistent between the transcriptome and epigenome. The core conserved molecular identities of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types allow us to generate a cross-species consensus classification of cell types, and to infer conserved properties of cell types across species. Despite the overall conservation, however, many species-dependent specializations are apparent, including differences in cell-type proportions, gene expression, DNA methylation and chromatin state. Few cell-type marker genes are conserved across species, revealing a short list of candidate genes and regulatory mechanisms that are responsible for conserved features of homologous cell types, such as the GABAergic chandelier cells. This consensus transcriptomic classification allows us to use patch–seq (a combination of whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, RNA sequencing and morphological characterization) to identify corticospinal Betz cells from layer 5 in non-human primates and humans, and to characterize their highly specialized physiology and anatomy. These findings highlight the robust molecular underpinnings of cell-type diversity in M1 across mammals, and point to the genes and regulatory pathways responsible for the functional identity of cell types and their species-specific adaptations.

Our results advance the collective knowledge and understanding of brain cell-type organization. First, our study reveals a unified molecular genetic landscape of cortical cell types that integrates their transcriptome, open chromatin and DNA methylation maps. Second, cross-species analysis achieves a consensus taxonomy of transcriptomic types and their hierarchical organization that is conserved from mouse to marmoset and human. Third, in situ single-cell transcriptomics provides a spatially resolved cell-type atlas of the motor cortex. Fourth, cross-modal analysis provides compelling evidence for the transcriptomic, epigenomic and gene regulatory basis of neuronal phenotypes such as their physiological and anatomical properties, demonstrating the biological validity and genomic underpinning of neuron types. We further present an extensive genetic toolset for targeting glutamatergic neuron types towards linking their molecular and developmental identity to their circuit function. Together, our results establish a unifying and mechanistic framework of neuronal cell-type organization that integrates multi-layered molecular genetic and spatial information with multi-faceted phenotypic properties.

Using optimized single-cell multiomics sequencing together with multiregional sampling of the primary tumor and lymphatic and distant metastases, we developed insights beyond intratumoral heterogeneity. Genome-wide DNA methylation levels were relatively consistent within a single genetic sublineage. The genome-wide DNA demethylation patterns of cancer cells were consistent in all 10 patients whose DNA we sequenced. The cancer cells’ DNA demethylation degrees clearly correlated with the densities of the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3 of normal tissue and those of repetitive element long interspersed nuclear element 1.

However, the distribution of PMDs in individual cells and the heterogeneity between cells are still unclear. In this study, the DNA methylation profiles of colorectal cancer detected by WGBS and scBS-seq were used to depict PMDs in individual cells for the first time. We found that more than half of the entire genome is covered by PMDs. Three subclasses of PMDS have distinct characteristics, and Gain-PMDs cover a higher proportion of protein coding genes. Gain-PMDs have extensive epigenetic heterogeneity between different cells of the same tumor, and the DNA methylation in cells is affected by the tumor microenvironment. In addition, abnormally elevated promoter methylation in Gain-PMDs may further promote the growth, proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells through silent transcription. The PMDs detected in this study have the potential as epigenetic biomarkers and provide a new insight for colorectal cancer research based on single-cell methylation data.

However, after epigenetic reprogramming in primordial germ cells, how and when DNA methylation is re-established in developing human oocytes remains to be characterized. Here, using single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we describe DNA methylation patterns in three different maturation stages of human oocytes. We found that while broad-scale patterns of CpG methylation have been largely established by the immature germinal vesicle stage, localized changes continue into later development. Non-CpG methylation, on the other hand, undergoes a large-scale, generalized remodeling through the final stage of maturation, with the net overall result being the accumulation of methylation as oocytes mature. The role of the genome-wide, non-CpG methylation remodeling in the final stage of oocyte maturation deserves further investigation.

This suggests a fairly high chance of errors. However, the consequences of such errors in terms of cell-to-cell variation have never been demonstrated by experimentally measuring intra-tissue heterogeneity in an adult organism. We employ single-cell DNA methylomics to analyze heterogeneity of genome-wide 5-methylcytosine (5mC) patterns within mouse liver. Our results indicate a surprisingly high level of heterogeneity, corresponding to an average epivariation frequency of approximately 3.3 %, with regions containing H3K4me1 being the most variable and promoters and CpG islands the most stable. Our data also indicate that the level of 5mC heterogeneity is dependent on genomic features. We find that non-functional sites such as repeat elements and introns are mostly unstable and potentially functional sites such as gene promoters are mostly stable. By employing a protocol for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of single cells, we show that the liver epigenome is highly unstable with an epivariation frequency in DNA methylation patterns of at least two orders of magnitude higher than somatic mutation frequencies.

Utilizing an optimized single-cell bisulfite sequencing protocol, we obtained quantitative DNA methylation measurements of up to 5.7 million CpGs in single hematopoietic cells. In parallel, we developed an analytical strategy (PDclust) to define single-cell DNA methylation states through pairwise comparisons of single-CpG methylation measurements.

We showed that local DNA methylation disorder is associated with cell–cell DNA methylation differences, is elevated in more aggressive tumors, links with transcriptional disruption and is altered during the environmental stress response. Glioma cells under in vitro hypoxic and irradiation stress increased local DNA methylation disorder and shifted cell states. We identified a positive association between genetic and epigenetic instability that was supported in bulk longitudinally collected DNA methylation data.

Although the DNA methylome of early human embryos has been analyzed, some of the key features have not been addressed thus far. Here we performed single-cell DNA methylome sequencing for human preimplantation embryos and found that tens of thousands of genomic loci exhibited de novo DNA methylation. This finding indicates that genome-wide DNA methylation reprogramming during preimplantation development is a dynamic balance between strong global demethylation and drastic focused remethylation. Furthermore, demethylation of the paternal genome is much faster and thorough than that of the maternal genome. From the two-cell to the postimplantation stage, methylation of the paternal genome is consistently lower than that of the maternal genome. We also show that the genetic lineage of early blastomeres can be traced by DNA methylation analysis.

Although increased cell-to-cell variability in transcription or epigenetic marks has been proposed to be a major hallmark of ageing, little is known about the molecular diversity of stem cells during ageing. Here we present a single cell multi-omics study of mouse muscle stem cells, combining single-cell transcriptome and DNA methylome profiling. Aged cells show a global increase of uncoordinated transcriptional heterogeneity biased towards genes regulating cell-niche interactions. We find context-dependent alterations of DNA methylation in aged stem cells. Importantly, promoters with increased methylation heterogeneity are associated with increased transcriptional heterogeneity of the genes they drive. These results indicate that epigenetic drift, by accumulation of stochastic DNA methylation changes in promoters, is associated with the degradation of coherent transcriptional networks during stem cell ageing. Furthermore, our observations also shed light on the mechanisms underlying the DNA methylation clock.

Using bulk RNA sequencing, splicing variation has been studied across human tissues and in genetically diverse populations. This has identified disease-relevant splicing events, as well as associations between splicing and genomic features, including sequence composition and conservation. However, variability in splicing between single cells from the same tissue or cell type and its determinants remains poorly understood. We applied parallel DNA methylation and transcriptome sequencing to differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cells to characterize splicing variation (exon skipping) and its determinants. Our results show that variation in single-cell splicing can be accurately predicted based on local sequence composition and genomic features. We observe moderate but consistent contributions from local DNA methylation profiles to splicing variation across cells. A combined model that is built based on genomic features as well as DNA methylation information accurately predicts different splicing modes of individual cassette exons. These categories include the conventional inclusion and exclusion patterns, but also more subtle modes of cell-to-cell variation in splicing.

However, because mutated and wild-type cells are admixed, we have limited ability to link genotypes with phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, we leveraged multi-modality single-cell sequencing, capturing genotype, transcriptomes and methylomes in progenitors from individuals with DNMT3A R882 mutated clonal hematopoiesis. DNMT3A mutations result in myeloid over lymphoid bias, and an expansion of immature myeloid progenitors primed toward megakaryocytic–erythroid fate, with dysregulated expression of lineage and leukemia stem cell markers. Mutated DNMT3A leads to preferential hypomethylation of polycomb repressive complex 2 targets and a specific CpG flanking motif. Notably, the hypomethylation motif is enriched in binding motifs of key hematopoietic transcription factors, serving as a potential mechanistic link between DNMT3A mutations and aberrant transcriptional phenotypes. Thus, single-cell multi-omics paves the road to defining the downstream consequences of mutations that drive clonal mosaicism.

Dynamic control of DNA methylation is therefore vital for embryogenesis, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from Dnmt and Tet mutant mouse embryos during early organogenesis. We show that both the maintenance and de novo methyltransferase enzymes are dispensable for the formation of all major cell types at E8.5. However, DNA methyltransferases are required for silencing of prior or alternative cell fates such as pluripotency and extraembryonic programmes. Deletion of all three TET enzymes produces substantial lineage biases, in particular, a failure to generate primitive erythrocytes. Single-cell multi-omics profiling moreover reveals that this is linked to a failure to demethylate distal regulatory elements in Tet triple-knockout embryos. This study provides a detailed analysis of the effects of perturbing DNA methylation on mouse organogenesis at a whole organism scale and affords new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of cell fate decisions.

Given the relatively low success rates of assisted reproductive technologies (ART; ∼25%), additives and adjuvants, such as glucocorticoids, are used to improve the success rate. Considering the dynamic developmental events that occur during this window, these exposures may alter blastocyst formation at a molecular level, and as such, affect not only the viability of the embryo and the ability of the blastocyst to implant, but also the developmental trajectory of the first three cell lineages, ultimately influencing the physiology of the embryo. In this study, we present a comprehensive single-cell transcriptome, methylome, and small RNA atlas in the day 7 human embryo. We show that, despite no change in morphology and developmental features, preimplantation glucocorticoid exposure reprograms the molecular profile of the trophectoderm (TE) lineage, and these changes are associated with an altered metabolic and inflammatory response. Our data also suggest that glucocorticoids can precociously mature the TE sublineages, supported by the presence of extravillous trophoblast markers in the polar sublineage and presence of X Chromosome dosage compensation. Further, we have elucidated that epigenetic regulation—DNA methylation and microRNAs (miRNAs)—likely underlies the transcriptional changes observed. This study suggests that exposures to exogenous compounds during preimplantation may unintentionally reprogram the human embryo, possibly leading to suboptimal development and longer-term health outcomes.

Here, to clarify the nature of epigenetic aging, we analyzed the aging dynamics of bulk-tissue and single-cell DNAm, together with single-cell DNAm changes during early development. We show that aging DNAm changes are widespread, but are relatively slow and small in amplitude, with DNAm levels trending towards intermediate values and showing increased heterogeneity with age. By considering dominant types of DNAm changes, we find that aging manifests in the exponential decay-like loss or gain of methylation with a universal rate, independent of the initial level of DNAm. We further show that aging is dominated by the stochastic component, yet co-regulated changes are also present during both development and adulthood. We support the finding of stochastic epigenetic aging by direct single-cell DNAm analyses and modeling of aging DNAm trajectories with a stochastic process akin to radiocarbon decay. Finally, we describe a single-cell algorithm for the identification of co-regulated CpG clusters that may provide new opportunities for targeting aging and evaluating longevity interventions.

Our current understanding of DNAme is based on measurements from bulk cell samples, which obscures intercellular differences and prevents analyses of rare cell types. Thus, the ability to measure DNAme in single cells has the potential to make important contributions to the understanding of several key biological processes, such as embryonic development, disease progression and aging. We have recently reported a method for generating genome-wide DNAme maps from single cells, using single-cell bisulfite sequencing (scBS-seq), allowing the quantitative measurement of DNAme at up to 50% of CpG dinucleotides throughout the mouse genome.

Here we report a novel method for genome-wide CpG island (CGI) methylation sequencing for single cells (scCGI-seq), combining methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion and multiple displacement amplification for selective detection of methylated CGIs. We applied this method to analyzing single cells from two types of hematopoietic cells, K562 and GM12878 and small populations of fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells. The method detected 21 798 CGIs (76% of all CGIs) per cell, and the number of CGIs consistently detected from all 16 profiled single cells was 20 864 (72.7%), with 12 961 promoters covered. This coverage represents a substantial improvement over results obtained using single cell reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, with a 66-fold increase in the fraction of consistently profiled CGIs across individual cells. Single cells of the same type were more similar to each other than to other types, but also displayed epigenetic heterogeneity. The method was further validated by comparing the CpG methylation pattern, methylation profile of CGIs/promoters and repeat regions and 41 classes of known regulatory markers to the ENCODE data. Although not every minor methylation differences between cells are detectable, scCGI-seq provides a solid tool for unsupervised stratification of a heterogeneous cell population.

Several single-cell dual- and multi-omics approaches have been reported that enable further investigation into cellular heterogeneity, including the discovery and in-depth study of rare cell populations. Such analyses will continue to provide important mechanistic insights into the regulatory consequences of epigenetic modifications. We recently reported a new method for profiling the DNA methylome and transcriptome from the same single cells in a cancer research study. Here, we present details of the protocol and provide guidance on its utility. Our Smart-RRBS (reduced representation bisulfite sequencing) protocol combines Smart-seq2 and RRBS and entails physically separating mRNA from the genomic DNA. It generates paired epigenetic promoter and RNA-expression measurements for ~24% of protein-coding genes in a typical single cell. It also works for micro-dissected tissue samples comprising hundreds of cells. The protocol, excluding flow sorting of cells and sequencing, takes ~3 d to process up to 192 samples manually. It requires basic molecular biology expertise and laboratory equipment, including a PCR workstation with UV sterilization, a DNA fluorometer and a microfluidic electrophoresis system.

Recently, we developed a single-cell reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (scRRBS) technique in which we modified the original RRBS method by integrating all the experimental steps before PCR amplification into a single-tube reaction. These modifications enable scRRBS to provide digitized methylation information on ∼1 million CpG sites within an individual diploid mouse or human cell at single-base resolution. Compared with the single-cell bisulfite sequencing (scBS) technique, scRRBS covers fewer CpG sites, but it provides better coverage for CpG islands (CGIs), which are likely to be the most informative elements for DNA methylation. The entire procedure takes ∼3 weeks, and it requires strong molecular biology skills.

The technique is highly sensitive and can detect the methylation status of up to 1.5 million CpG sites within the genome of an individual mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC). Moreover, we show that the technique can detect the methylation status of individual CpG sites in a haploid sperm cell in a digitized manner as either unmethylated or fully methylated. Furthermore, we show that the demethylation dynamics of maternal and paternal genomes after fertilization can be traced within the individual pronuclei of mouse zygotes. The demethylation process of the genic regions is faster than that of the intergenic regions in both male and female pronuclei. Our method paves the way for the exploration of the dynamic methylome landscapes of individual cells at single-base resolution during physiological processes such as embryonic development, or during pathological processes such as tumorigenesis.

A major challenge has been to understand the direct correlation of DNA methylation and gene expression within single-cells. Due to large cell-to-cell variability and the lack of direct measurements of transcriptome and methylome of the same cell, the association is still unclear. Here, we describe a novel method (scMT-seq) that simultaneously profiles both DNA methylome and transcriptome from the same cell. In sensory neurons, we consistently identify transcriptome and methylome heterogeneity among single cells but the majority of the expression variance is not explained by proximal promoter methylation, with the exception of genes that do not contain CpG islands. By contrast, gene body methylation is positively associated with gene expression for only those genes that contain a CpG island promoter. Furthermore, using single nucleotide polymorphism patterns from our hybrid mouse model, we also find positive correlation of allelic gene body methylation with allelic expression. Our method can be used to detect transcriptome, methylome, and single nucleotide polymorphism information within single cells to dissect the mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation.

However, to accurately analyze the mechanism by which transcriptome, genome and DNA methylome regulate each other, these omic methods need to be performed in the same single cell. Here we demonstrate a single-cell triple omics sequencing technique, scTrio-seq, that can be used to simultaneously analyze the genomic copy-number variations (CNVs), DNA methylome, and transcriptome of an individual mammalian cell. We show that large-scale CNVs cause proportional changes in RNA expression of genes within the gained or lost genomic regions, whereas these CNVs generally do not affect DNA methylation in these regions. Furthermore, we applied scTrio-seq to 25 single cancer cells derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue sample. We identified two subpopulations within these cells based on CNVs, DNA methylome, or transcriptome of individual cells. Our work offers a new avenue of dissecting the complex contribution of genomic and epigenomic heterogeneities to the transcriptomic heterogeneity within a population of cells.

These aberrations are likely to arise during genomic reprogramming in mammalian preimplantation embryos, when their epigenomes are most vulnerable. However, this process is only partially understood because of the experimental inaccessibility of early-stage embryos. Here, we introduce a methodologic advance, probing single cells for various DNA-methylation errors at multiple loci, to reveal failed maintenance of epigenetic mark results in chimeric mice, which display unpredictable phenotypes leading to developmental arrest. Yet we show that mouse pronuclear transfer can be used to ameliorate such reprogramming defects.

We develop a mathematical model that reproduces the strand bias and use this model to make two predictions. First, the variation in strand bias should decrease when 5hmC turnover increases. Second, the strand bias of two sister cells should be strongly anti-correlated. We validate these predictions experimentally, and use our model to reconstruct lineages of two- and four-cell mouse embryos, showing that single-cell 5hmC sequencing can be used as a lineage reconstruction tool.

We mapped high- to low-coverage SBS short reads of mouse and human female developing germ cells to consensus sequences of repetitive elements that were multiplied in the respective host genome. This mapping strategy effectively identified active and evolutionarily young retrotransposon subfamilies and centromeric satellite repeats that were resistant to DNA demethylation during the investigated progressive stages of germ cell development. Notably, quantities of only tens of thousands of uniquely mapped reads provided sufficient sensitivity to allow for methylation analyses of multiple retrotransposons and satellite repeats in mice. Furthermore, we produced SBS results from single female murine germ cells by an improved multiplexing and amplification-free SBS method (scPBAT). The scPBAT results quantitatively provided ≥5× sequencing coverage for at least 30 repeats, and the individual methylation patterns detected were similar to the bulk cell-based results. Our single-cell methylome sequencing technique will allow researchers to investigate intergenic methylation characteristics from limited amounts of mammalian cells as well as cells from other organisms with genomic annotations.

However, no previous report has described how PCR-based duplication-induced artifacts affect the accuracy of this method when measuring DNA methylation levels. For quantifying the effects of duplication-induced artifacts on methylome profiling when using ultra-trace amounts of starting material, we developed a novel method, namely quantitative RRBS (Q-RRBS), in which PCR-induced duplication is excluded through the use of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). By performing Q-RRBS on varying amounts of starting material, we determined that duplication-induced artifacts were more severe when small quantities of the starting material were used. However, through using the UMIs, we successfully eliminated these artifacts. In addition, Q-RRBS could accurately detect allele-specific methylation in absence of allele-specific genetic variants. Our results demonstrate that Q-RRBS is an optimal strategy for DNA methylation profiling of single cells or samples containing ultra-trace amounts of cells.

The basic steps include isolating and lysing single cells, digesting genomic DNA with a methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease (MSRE) and amplification of multiple targets by two rounds of PCR to determine the methylation status of target sites. The method can reliably and accurately detect the methylation status of multiple target sites in each single cell, and it can be completed in a relatively short time (<2 d) at low cost. Consequently, the method may be preferable over whole-genome methods in applications requiring highly reliable and cost-effective coverage of specific target sites in all cells from a sample and in cases when the DNA methylation states of single CpG sites are representative of the methylation status of corresponding regions of interest.

The amount of diseases suspected of being influenced by DNA methylation is rising steadily and includes common diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, atherosclerosis, cancer, major psychosis, lupus and Parkinson’s disease. Due to cellular heterogeneity of methylation patterns, epigenetic analyses of single cells become a necessity. One rationale is that DNA methylation profiles are highly variable across individual cells, even in the same organ, dependent on the function of the gene, disease state, exposure to environmental factors (e.g. radiation, drugs or nutrition), stochastic fluctuations and various other causes. Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-slide microreaction system, we present here a methylation-sensitive PCR analysis, the restriction enzyme-based single-cell methylation assay (RSMA), in the analysis of DNA methylation patterns in single cells. This method addresses the problems of cell heterogeneity in epigenetics research; it is comparably affordable, avoids complicated microfluidic systems and offers the opportunity for high-throughput screening, as many single cells can be screened in parallel.

The global erasure of 5mC from the parental genomes during preimplantation mammalian development is critical to reset the methylome of gametes to the cells in the blastocyst. While active and passive modes of demethylation have both been suggested to play a role in this process, the relative contribution of these two mechanisms to 5mC erasure remains unclear. Here, we report a single-cell method (scMspJI-seq) that enables strand-specific quantification of 5mC, allowing us to systematically probe the dynamics of global demethylation. When applied to mouse embryonic stem cells, we identified substantial cell-to-cell strand-specific 5mC heterogeneity, with a small group of cells displaying asymmetric levels of 5mCpG between the two DNA strands of a chromosome suggesting loss of maintenance methylation. Next, in preimplantation mouse embryos, we discovered that methylation maintenance is active till the 16-cell stage followed by passive demethylation in a fraction of cells within the early blastocyst at the 32-cell stage of development. Finally, human preimplantation embryos qualitatively show temporally delayed yet similar demethylation dynamics as mouse embryos. Collectively, these results demonstrate that scMspJI-seq is a sensitive and cost-effective method to map the strand-specific genome-wide patterns of 5mC in single cells.

Although previous studies have identified cell types using individual molecular signatures, the generation of consensus cell type classification requires the integration of multiple data types. Most existing single-cell techniques can only make one type of molecular measurement. Here we describe single-nucleus methylcytosine and transcriptome sequencing (snmCT-seq), a multi-omic method that requires no physical separation of DNA and RNA molecules. We demonstrated that snmCT-seq profiles generated from single cells or nuclei robustly distinguish human cell types and accurately measures cytosine DNA methylation and gene expression signatures of each cell type.

Single-cell whole genome DNA methylation profiling methods hold great potential to resolve the DNA methylation profiles of individual cell-types. Here we present a method that couples single-cell combinatorial indexing (sci) with enzymatic conversion (sciEM) of unmethylated cytosines. The sciEM method facilitates DNA methylation profiling of single-cells that is highly correlated with single-cell bisulfite-based workflows (r2 > 0.99) whilst improving sequencing alignment rates, reducing adapter contamination and over-estimation of DNA methylation levels (CpG and non-CpG). As proof-of-concept we perform sciEM analysis of the temporal lobe, motor cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of the human brain to resolve single-cell DNA methylation of all major cell-types. To our knowledge sciEM represents the first non-bisulfite single-cell DNA methylation sequencing approach with single-base resolution.	bedtools, bowtie2, parallel, picard, samtools, trimmomatic	sciMET	Single-cell DNA methylation sequencing by combinatorial indexing and enzymatic DNA methylation conversion	5.502738023	3.718135968	4.939628714	None		Chatterton Z, Lamichhane P, Ahmadi Rastegar D, Fitzpatrick L, Lebhar H, Marquis C, Halliday G, Kwok JB.

DeepLiver	None	0	regulatory network inference, other	regulatory network inference (gene-gene), chromatin accessibility annotation, chromatin zonation state annotation	To investigate how these TFs cooperate with cell type TFs, we performed an in vivo massively parallel reporter assay on 12,000 hepatocyte enhancers and used these data to train a hierarchical deep learning model (called DeepLiver) that exploits both enhancer accessibility and activity.	10.1101/2022.12.08.519575	Preprint	Preprint	https://github.com/aertslab/Bravo_et_al_LiverP	2022.12.27	2022.12.27		convolutional neural network, transfer learning	CAS	2022.12.08	None			2		Cell type identity is encoded by gene regulatory networks (GRN), in which transcription factors (TFs) bind to enhancers to regulate target gene expression. In the mammalian liver, lineage TFs have been characterized for the main cell types, including hepatocytes. Hepatocytes cover a relatively broad cellular state space, as they differ significantly in their metabolic state, and function, depending on their position with respect to the central or portal vein in a liver lobule. It is unclear whether this spatially defined cellular state space, called zonation, is also governed by a well-defined gene regulatory code. To address this challenge, we have mapped enhancer-GRNs across liver cell types at high resolution, using a combination of single cell multiomics, spatial omics, GRN inference, and deep learning. We found that cell state changes in transcription and chromatin accessibility in hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatic stellate cells depend on zonation. Enhancer-GRN mapping suggests that zonation states in hepatocytes are driven by the repressors Tcf7l1 and Tbx3, that modulate the core hepatocyte GRN, controlled by Hnf4a, Cebpa, Hnf1a, Onecut1 and Foxa1, among others. To investigate how these TFs cooperate with cell type TFs, we performed an in vivo massively parallel reporter assay on 12,000 hepatocyte enhancers and used these data to train a hierarchical deep learning model (called DeepLiver) that exploits both enhancer accessibility and activity. DeepLiver confirms Cebpa, Onecut, Foxa1, Hnf1a and Hnf4a as drivers of enhancer specificity in hepatocytes; Tcf7l1/2 and Tbx3 as regulators of the zonation state; and Hnf4a, Hnf1a, AP-1 and Ets as activators. Finally, taking advantage of in silico mutagenesis predictions from DeepLiver and enhancer assays, we confirmed that the destruction of Tcf7l1/2 or Tbx3 motifs in zonated enhancers abrogates their zonation bias. Our study provides a multi-modal understanding of the regulatory code underlying hepatocyte identity and their zonation state, that can be exploited to engineer enhancers with specific activity levels and zonation patterns.

Pharmacoepigenetic studies have identified differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) in cord blood between exposed and unexposed neonates. However, the causal implications and impact of prenatal long-term paracetamol exposure on brain development are not known. Methods We exposed human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) undergoing in vitro neuronal differentiation to daily changes of media containing amount of paracetamol corresponding to human foetal exposure with maternal therapeutic doses. An integrated multi-omics approach was used to investigate epigenetic and transcriptomic effects of paracetamol on the early stages of human brain development. Results Multi-omics analyses of DNAm, chromatin opening, and gene expression identified dose-dependent effects on cell proliferation and maturation. We found differentially methylated and/or expressed genes involved in signal transduction, neurotransmitter secretion and cell fate determination trajectories. Integration of single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq showed that paracetamol-induced changes in chromatin opening were linked to transcription. For example, EP300 encoding a histone acetyltransferase and H3K27ac were linked to many putative cis regulatory elements and downregulated upon paracetamol exposure. Some of the genes are involved in neuronal injury, response to toxic insults and development-specific pathways, such as KCNE3, overlapped with differentially methylated genes previously identified in cord blood associated with prenatal paracetamol exposure. Conclusion We identified dose-dependent epigenetic and transcriptional changes in hESCs undergoing neuronal differentiation after paracetamol exposure. The overlap of differentially methylated genes with our previous analysis in cord blood from children exposed to paracetamol during pregnancy could suggest a causal role in impaired neurodevelopment.

It provides a unique opportunity to jointly analyze multimodal data at the single-cell level for the identification of distinct cell types. A correct clustering result is essential for the downstream complex biological functional studies. However, combining different data sources for clustering analysis of single-cell multimodal data remains a statistical and computational challenge. Here, we develop a novel multimodal deep learning method, scMDC, for single-cell multi-omics data clustering analysis. scMDC is an end-to-end deep model that explicitly characterizes different data sources and jointly learns latent features of deep embedding for clustering analysis. Extensive simulation and real-data experiments reveal that scMDC outperforms existing single-cell single-modal and multimodal clustering methods on different single-cell multimodal datasets. The linear scalability of running time makes scMDC a promising method for analyzing large multimodal datasets.	pytorch, scanpy, sklearn, numpy, h5py	BREM-SC, CiteFuse, Specter, SeuratV4, SCVIS, TotalVI, SC3, Tscan, IDEC, K-means, Cobolt, scMM, K-means+PCA	Clustering of single-cell multi-omics data with a multimodal deep learning method	14.22379001	8.88587695	13.31198738	None	3	Lin X, Tian T, Wei Z, Hakonarson H.

Integrating multimodal data from different sequencing technologies, i.e. mosaic data, permits larger-scale investigation with more modalities and can help to better reveal cellular heterogeneity. However, mosaic integration involves major challenges, particularly regarding modality alignment and batch effect removal. Here we present a deep probabilistic framework for the mosaic integration and knowledge transfer (MIDAS) of single-cell multimodal data. MIDAS simultaneously achieves dimensionality reduction, imputation, and batch correction of mosaic data by employing self-supervised modality alignment and information-theoretic latent disentanglement. We demonstrate its superiority to other methods and reliability by evaluating its performance in full trimodal integration and various mosaic tasks. We also constructed a single-cell trimodal atlas of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and tailored transfer learning and reciprocal reference mapping schemes to enable flexible and accurate knowledge transfer from the atlas to new data.

The algorithm improves the prediction accuracy of relations among transcription factors (TFs), enhancers, and genes by two new ideas: (i) a Steiner forest problem model to identify the set of highly confident enhancer-gene relations underlying a context-specific functional gene module; and (ii) a hybrid biclustering pipeline integrated with submodular optimization for inferring eGRNs by identifying the optimal set of hybrid biclusters, each of which represents co-regulated genes by the same TF and co-accessible enhancers bound by the same TF over a cell subpopulation. These two ideas are embedded in an iterative framework by finding patterns in a pair of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility matrices. Benchmarking analysis shows that the performance, assessed by f-scores, precision, or recall, was significantly improved by our program compared to four state-of-the-art tools on nine datasets. Besides, by implementing STREAM on an Alzheimer’s disease dataset, we identified TF-enhancer-gene relations associated with pseudotime and investigated the changing of enhancer-gene relations alongside cell lineages. Additionally, by implementing STREAM on a diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma dataset, we excavated key TF-enhancer-gene relations and TF cooperation underlying tumor cells.

Here we developed a multimodal and optimized iteration of scCUT&Tag called nano-CT (for nano-CUT&Tag) that allows simultaneous probing of three epigenomic modalities at single-cell resolution, using nanobody-Tn5 fusion proteins. nano-CT is compatible with starting materials as low as 25 000 cells and has significantly higher resolution than scCUT&Tag, with a 16-fold increase in the number of fragments per cells. We used nano-CT to simultaneously profile chromatin accessibility, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 in a complex tissue - juvenile mouse brain. The obtained multimodal dataset allowed for discrimination of more cell types/states that scCUT&Tag, and inference of chromatin velocity between ATAC and H3K27ac in the oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage. In addition, we used nano-CT to deconvolute H3K27me3 repressive states and infer two sequential waves of H3K27me3 repression at distinct gene modules during OL lineage progression. Thus, given its high resolution, versatility, and multimodal features, nano-CT allows unique insights in epigenetic landscapes in different biological systems at single cell level.	snakemake, fasterq, papermill, Signac, Seurat, Ggally, SingleCellExperiment	scCUT&Tag	Multimodal chromatin profiling using nanobody-based single-cell CUT&Tag	8.565479845	6.228027519	5.539832631	10.1101/2022.03.08.483459	1	Bartosovic M, Castelo-Branco G.

How chromatin states underlie lineage choice in single cells is relatively unexplored. We develop sort-assisted single-cell chromatin immunocleavage (sortChIC) and map active (H3K4me1 and H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3 and H3K9me3) histone modifications in the mouse bone marrow. During differentiation, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) acquire active chromatin states mediated by cell-type-specifying transcription factors, which are unique for each lineage. By contrast, most alterations in repressive marks during differentiation occur independent of the final cell type. Chromatin trajectory analysis shows that lineage choice at the chromatin level occurs at the progenitor stage. Joint profiling of H3K4me1 and H3K9me3 demonstrates that cell types within the myeloid lineage have distinct active chromatin but share similar myeloid-specific heterochromatin states. This implies a hierarchical regulation of chromatin during hematopoiesis: heterochromatin dynamics distinguish differentiation trajectories and lineages, while euchromatin dynamics reflect cell types within lineages.

Sample multiplexing techniques are valuable when performing single-cell analysis, reducing technical variation and permitting cost efficiencies. Several commercially available methods are available and have been used in many scRNA-seq studies. On the other hand, while several methods have been published, the multiplexing techniques for single nuclear Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (snATAC)-seq assays remain under development. We developed a simple nucleus hashing method using oligonucleotide conjugated antibodies recognizing nuclear pore complex proteins, NuHash, to perform snATAC-seq library preparations by multiplexing. Results We performed multiplexing snATAC-seq analyses on the mixture of human and mouse cell samples (two samples, 2-plex, and four samples, 4-plex) using NuHash. The demultiplexing accuracy of NuHash was high, and only ten out of 9,144 nuclei (2-plex) and 150 of 12,208 nuclei (4-plex) had discordant classifications between NuHash demultiplexing and discrimination using reference genome alignments. We compared results between snATAC-seq and deeply sequenced bulk ATAC-seq on the same samples and found that most of the peaks detected in snATAC-seq were also detected in deeply sequenced bulk ATAC-seq. The bulk ATAC-seq signal intensity was positively correlated with the number of cell subtype clusters detected in snATAC-seq, but not the subset of peaks detected in all clusters. These subsets of snATAC-seq peaks showed different distributions over different genomic features, suggesting that the peak intensities of bulk ATAC-seq can be used to identify different types of functional loci. Conclusions Our multiplexing method using oligo-conjugated anti-nuclear pore complex proteins, NuHash, permits high accuracy demultiplexing of samples. The NuHash protocol is straightforward, it works on frozen samples, and requires no modifications for snATAC-seq library preparation.

Liam learns a joint low-dimensional representation of two concurrently measured modalities, which proves beneficial when the information content or quality of the modalities differ. Its integration accounts for complex batch effects using a tuneable combination of conditional and adversarial training and can be optimized using replicate information while retaining selected biological variation.

ASTER outperformed baseline methods in systematic evaluation on 27 datasets of various protocols, sizes, numbers of cell types, degrees of cell-type imbalance, cell states and qualities, providing valuable guidance for scCAS data analysis.	numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, kneed, scanpy, episcanpy, igraph, louvain, leidenalg, tqdm	Louvain, Leiden, scCCESS, scLCA	ASTER: accurately estimating the number of cell types in single-cell chromatin accessibility data	18.35674909	26.08251141	17.44763396	None	27	Chen S, Wang R, Long W, Jiang R.

Multi-omics assays offer even greater opportunities to understand cellular states and biological processes. The problem of integrating different omics data with very different dimensionality and statistical properties remains, however, quite challenging. A growing body of computational tools is being developed for this task, leveraging ideas ranging from machine translation to the theory of networks, and represents another frontier on the interface of biology and data science. Our goal in this review paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date survey of computational techniques for the integration of single-cell multi-omics data while making the concepts behind each algorithm approachable to a non-expert audience.

However, cell-type identification of scATAC-seq data is known to be challenging due to the heterogeneity derived from different protocols and the high dropout rate. Results: In this study, we perform a systematic comparison of seven scATAC-seq datasets of mouse brain to benchmark the efficacy of neuronal cell-type annotation from gene sets. We find that redundant marker genes give a dramatic improvement for a sparse scATAC-seq annotation across the data collected from different studies. Interestingly, simple aggregation of such marker genes achieves performance comparable or higher than that of machine-learning classifiers, suggesting its potential for downstream applications. Based on our results, we reannotated all scATAC-seq data for detailed cell types using robust marker genes. Their meta scATAC-seq profiles are publicly available at https://gillisweb.cshl.edu/Meta_scATAC. Furthermore, we trained a deep neural network to predict chromatin accessibility from only DNA sequence and identified key motifs enriched for each neuronal subtype. Those predicted profiles are visualized together in our database as a valuable resource to explore cell-type specific epigenetic regulation in a sequence-dependent and -independent manner.	scanpy, Seurat v3, BBKNN, LassoVariants	None	Learning single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles using meta-analytic marker genes 	6.84771066	8.635320304	6.709893368	10.1101/2021.04.01.438068v2	7	Karakida Kawaguchi R, Tang Z, Fischer S, Rajesh C, Tripathy R, Koo PK, Gillis J.

Recent advances have enabled mapping of histone marks in single cells, but most methods are constrained to profile only one histone mark per cell. Here, we present an integrated experimental and computational framework, scChIX-seq (single-cell chromatin immunocleavage and unmixing sequencing), to map several histone marks in single cells. scChIX-seq multiplexes two histone marks together in single cells, then computationally deconvolves the signal using training data from respective histone mark profiles. This framework learns the cell-type-specific correlation structure between histone marks, and therefore does not require a priori assumptions of their genomic distributions. Using scChIX-seq, we demonstrate multimodal analysis of histone marks in single cells across a range of mark combinations. Modeling dynamics of in vitro macrophage differentiation enables integrated analysis of chromatin velocity. Overall, scChIX-seq unlocks systematic interrogation of the interplay between histone modifications in single cells.

Here we integrate information from measurements of chromatin activity, gene expression and function in single beta cells with genetic association data to identify disease-causal gene regulatory changes in T2D. Using machine learning on chromatin accessibility data from 34 non-diabetic, pre-T2D and T2D donors, we robustly identify two transcriptionally and functionally distinct beta cell subtypes that undergo an abundance shift in T2D. Subtype-defining active chromatin is enriched for T2D risk variants, suggesting a causal contribution of subtype identity to T2D. Both subtypes exhibit activation of a stress-response transcriptional program and functional impairment in T2D, which is likely induced by the T2D-associated metabolic environment. Our findings demonstrate the power of multimodal single-cell measurements combined with machine learning for identifying mechanisms of complex diseases.

However, most existing methods suffer from inaccurate dimensionality reduction for the joint-modality data, hindering their discovery of novel or rare cell subpopulations. Results: Here, we present VIMCCA, a computational framework based on variational-assisted multi-view canonical correlation analysis to integrate paired multimodal single-cell data. Our statistical model uses a common latent variable to interpret the common source of variances in two different data modalities. Our approach jointly learns an inference model and two modality-specific non-linear models by leveraging variational inference and deep learning. We perform VIMCCA and compare it with ten existing state-of-the-art algorithms on four paired multi-modal datasets sequenced by different protocols. Results demonstrate that VIMCCA facilitates integrating various types of joint-modality data, thus leading to more reliable and accurate downstream analysis. VIMCCA improves our ability to identify novel or rare cell subtypes compared to existing widely used methods. Besides, it can also facilitate inferring cell lineage based on joint-modality profiles.	scanpy, tensorflow, anndata, scipy, pandas, seaborn, keras, python-igraph, louvain, h5py	PCA, scVAE, scVI, PeakVI, scMVAE, Cobolt	A multi-view latent variable model reveals cellular heterogeneity in complex tissues for paired multimodal single-cell data 	13.25684722	8.780057597	9.189808853	None	2	Wang Y, Lian B, Zhang H, Zhong Y, He J, Wu F, Reinert K, Shang X, Yang H, Hu J.

Since changes in methylation status of a CpG site may be retained in mitosis, they could be used to infer the progression history of a tumor via single-cell lineage tree reconstruction. In this work, we introduce the first principled distance-based computational method, Sgootr, for inferring a tumor’s single-cell methylation lineage tree and jointly identifying lineage-informative CpG sites which harbor changes in methylation status that are retained along the lineage. We apply Sgootr on the single-cell bisulfite-treated whole genome sequencing data of multiregionally-sampled tumor cells from 9 metastatic colorectal cancer patients made available by Bian et al., as well as multiregionally-sampled single-cell reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing data from a glioblastoma patient made available by Chaligne et al.. We demonstrate that the tumor lineages constructed reveal a simple model underlying colorectal tumor progression and metastatic seeding. A comparison of Sgootr against alternative approaches shows that Sgootr can construct lineage trees with fewer migration events and more in concordance with the sequential-progression model of tumor evolution, in time a fraction of that used in prior studies. Interestingly, lineage-informative CpG sites identified by Sgootr are in inter-CpG island (CGI) regions, as opposed to CGI’s, which have been the main regions of interest in genomic methylation-related analyses. Sgootr is implemented as a Snakemake workflow, available at https://github.com/algo-cancer/Sgootr.	scikit-learn, scipy, numpy, pandas	IQ-TREE, FG+IQ-TREE	Single-cell methylation sequencing data reveal succinct metastatic migration histories and tumor progression models	7.423328206	8.097433579	7.949172519	10.1101/2021.03.22.436475	6	Li XC, Liu Y, Mehrabadi FR, Malikić S, Mount SM, Ruppin E, Aldape K, Sahinalp SC.

Single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) is a powerful technique for interrogating single-cell chromatin-based gene regulation, and genes or gene sets with dynamic regulatory potentials can be regarded as cell-type specific markers as if in scRNA-seq. However, there are few GSS tools specifically designed for scATAC-seq, and the applicability and performance of RNA-seq GSS tools on scATAC-seq data remain to be investigated. We systematically benchmarked ten GSS tools, including four bulk RNA-seq tools, five single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) tools, and one scATAC-seq method. First, using matched scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq datasets, we find that the performance of GSS tools on scATAC-seq data is comparable to that on scRNA-seq, suggesting their applicability to scATAC-seq. Then the performance of different GSS tools were extensively evaluated using up to ten scATAC-seq datasets. Moreover, we evaluated the impact of gene activity conversion, dropout imputation, and gene set collections on the results of GSS. Results show that dropout imputation can significantly promote the performance of almost all GSS tools, while the impact of gene activity conversion methods or gene set collections on GSS performance is more GSS tool or dataset dependent. Finally, we provided practical guidelines for choosing appropriate pre-processing methods and GSS tools in different scenarios.

Hi-C measurement provided a wealth of information on chromatin interactions. Emerging evidence suggests functional chromatin interactions are related to gene expression. However, gene promoters and their regulatory elements can be separated by 103-106 bp apart. Therefore, examining 3D chromatin conformations and identifying functionally long-range interactions are important for deciphering the structure-function relationship of 3D genome. Our recent work of CHROMATIX deep sampling algorithms can identify non-random chromatin interactions (5-7% of total Hi-C). These can be used to generate large ensembles of 3D single-cell chromatin conformations, accurately reproducing both single-cell capture and imaging studies, as well as population Hi-C measurements. In this study, we examine predicted ensembles of single-cell 3D chromatin conformations of loci among leukemia K562 cells, lymphoblastoid GM12878 cells, and lung fibroblast IMR90 cells. We identified small subsets of non-random chromatin interactions from Hi-C data based on large random ensembles of 3D chromatin chains folded in confined nuclear volume. These non-random interactions were used to generate ensembles of 5.0×104 single-cell 3D conformations for individual loci. We further quantified the heterogeneity of 3D chromatin conformations by clustering, with each spatial cluster and its proportion defined. In addition, we carried out an integrated analysis of RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and epigenetic data of these cell lines. Results show that cell-specific functional chromatin interactions provide 3D basis for differential gene expression. There are well-defined signatures of 3D subpopulations of chromatin conformations involving distinctive patterns of epigenetic marks, and these signatures are strongly associated with gene differential expression.

Here, we introduce an algorithm, eNet, to build enhancer networks by integrating single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiles. The complexity of enhancer networks is assessed by two metrics: the number of enhancers and the frequency of predicted enhancer interactions (PEIs) based on chromatin co-accessibility. We apply eNet algorithm to a human blood dataset and find cell identity and disease genes tend to be regulated by complex enhancer networks. The network hub enhancers (enhancers with frequent PEIs) are the most functionally important. Compared with super-enhancers, enhancer networks show better performance in predicting cell identity and disease genes. eNet is robust and widely applicable in various human or mouse tissues datasets. Thus, we propose a model of enhancer networks containing three modes: Simple, Multiple and Complex, which are distinguished by their complexity in regulating gene expression. Taken together, our work provides an unsupervised approach to simultaneously identify key cell identity and disease genes and explore the underlying regulatory relationships among enhancers in single cells.

Meticulous single-cell multiomics integration models are required to avoid biases towards a specific modality and overcome the sparsity. Batch effects obfuscating biological signals must also be taken into account. Here, we introduce a new single-cell multiomics integration model, Single-cell Multiomics Autoencoder Integration (scMaui) based on stacked variational encoders and adversarial learning. scMaui reduces the dimensionality of integrated data modalities to a latent space which outlines cellular heterogeneity.

To obtain insight into the mechanisms that govern gene regulation, it is imperative to study their combined mode of action and interconnectivity. However, it has been challenging to simultaneously measure a combination of these factors within one sample. Here, we introduce MAbID, a method that combines genomic profiling of many histone modifications and chromatin-binding proteins in a single reaction. MAbID employs antibody-DNA conjugates to enable genomic barcoding of chromatin at sites of epitope occupancy. This barcoding strategy allows for the combined incubation of multiple antibodies in a single sample to reveal the genomic distributions of many epigenetic states simultaneously. We used MAbID to profile both active and inactive chromatin types in human cell lines and multiplexed measurements in the same sample without loss of data quality. Moreover, we obtained joint measurements of six epitopes covering all major chromatin types in single cells during mouse in vitro neural differentiation and captured associated changes in multifactorial chromatin states. Thus, MAbID holds the potential to gain unique insights into the interplay between gene regulatory mechanisms, especially in settings with limited sample material and in single cells.

We propose scMoMaT, a method that is able to integrate single cell multi-omics data under the mosaic integration scenario using matrix tri-factorization. During integration, scMoMaT is also able to uncover the cluster specific bio-markers across modalities. These multi-modal bio-markers are used to interpret and annotate the clusters to cell types. Moreover, scMoMaT can integrate cell batches with unequal cell type compositions. Applying scMoMaT to multiple real and simulated datasets demonstrated these features of scMoMaT and showed that scMoMaT has superior performance compared to existing methods. Specifically, we show that integrated cell embedding combined with learned bio-markers lead to cell type annotations of higher quality or resolution compared to their original annotations.	torch, scipy, sklearn, leidenalg, adjustText	MultiMap, UINMF, Stabmap	scMoMaT jointly performs single cell mosaic integration and multi-modal bio-marker detection	15.75191542	14.06443053	10.14224695	None	8	Zhang Z, Sun H, Mariappan R, Chen X, Chen X, Jain MS, Efremova M, Teichmann SA, Rajan V, Zhang X. scMoMaT jointly performs single cell mosaic integration and multi-modal bio-marker detection.

Massive and heterogeneous 3C+ data require high-performance and flexible processing of sequenced reads into contact pairs. To meet these challenges, we present pairtools – a flexible suite of tools for contact extraction from sequencing data. Pairtools provides modular command-line interface (CLI) tools that can be flexibly chained into data processing pipelines. Pairtools provides both crucial core tools as well as auxiliary tools for building feature-rich 3C+ pipelines, including contact pair manipulation, filtration, and quality control. Benchmarking pairtools against popular 3C+ data pipelines shows advantages of pairtools for high-performance and flexible 3C+ analysis. Finally, pairtools provides protocol-specific tools for multi-way contacts, haplotype-resolved contacts, and single-cell Hi-C. The combination of CLI tools and tight integration with Python data analysis libraries makes pairtools a versatile foundation for a broad range of 3C+ pipelines.	cython, pysam, bioframe, pyyaml, numpy, scipy, pandas, click, sort, bgzip, samtools	None	Pairtools: from sequencing data to chromosome contacts	73.73149635	46.05138678	13.05121758	10.1101/2023.02.13.528389	3	Open2C, Abdennur N, Fudenberg G, Flyamer IM, Galitsyna AA, Goloborodko A, Imakaev M, Venev SV.

Matching a single-cell epigenome profile to a large pool of reference cells remains a major challenge. Here, we present scEpiSearch, which enables searching, comparison, and independent classification of single-cell open-chromatin profiles against a large reference of single-cell expression and open-chromatin data sets. Across performance benchmarks, scEpiSearch outperformed multiple methods in accuracy of search and low-dimensional coembedding of single-cell profiles, irrespective of platforms and species. Here we also demonstrate the unconventional utilities of scEpiSearch by applying it on single-cell epigenome profiles of K562 cells and samples from patients with acute leukaemia to reveal different aspects of their heterogeneity, multipotent behavior, and dedifferentiated states. Applying scEpiSearch on our single-cell open-chromatin profiles from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we identified ESC subpopulations with more activity and poising for endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response. Thus, scEpiSearch solves the nontrivial problem of amalgamating information from a large pool of single cells to identify and study the regulatory states of cells using their single-cell epigenomes.

We describe scTriangulate, a computational framework to mix-and-match multiple clustering results, modalities, associated algorithms, and resolutions to achieve an optimal solution. Rather than ensemble approaches which select the “consensus”, scTriangulate picks the most stable solution through coalitional iteration. When evaluated on diverse multimodal technologies, scTriangulate outperforms alternative approaches to identify high-confidence cell-populations and modality-specific subtypes. Unlike existing integration strategies that rely on modality-specific joint embedding or geometric graphs, scTriangulate makes no assumption about the distributions of raw underlying values. As a result, this approach can solve unprecedented integration challenges, including the ability to automate reference cell-atlas construction, resolve clonal architecture within molecularly defined cell-populations and subdivide clusters to discover splicing-defined disease subtypes. scTriangulate is a flexible strategy for unified integration of single-cell or multimodal clustering solutions, from nearly unlimited sources.	squidpy, gseapy, scrublet, yattag, anytree, mygene	HGPA, MCLA	Decision level integration of unimodal and multimodal single cell data with scTriangulate	30.54403744	20.89251293	10.01678681	None	5	Li G, Song B, Singh H, Surya Prasath VB, Leighton Grimes H, Salomonis N.

Integrating these modalities provides a comprehensive view of cellular identity. Current integration methods rely on overlapping features or cells to link datasets measuring different modalities, limiting their application to experiments where different molecular layers are profiled in different subsets of cells. Results: We present scTopoGAN, a method for unsupervised manifold alignment of single-cell datasets with non-overlapping cells or features. We use topological autoencoders to obtain latent representations of each modality separately. A topology-guided Generative Adversarial Network then aligns these latent representations into a common space. We show that scTopoGAN outperforms state-of-the-art manifold alignment methods in complete unsupervised settings. Interestingly, the topological autoencoder for individual modalities also showed better performance in preserving the original structure of the data in the low-dimensional representations when compared to other manifold projection methods. Taken together, we show that the concept of topology preservation might be a powerful tool to align multiple single modality datasets, unleashing the potential of multi-omic interpretations of cells.	torch, numpy, pandas	VAE, AE	scTopoGAN: Unsupervised manifold alignment of single-cell data	6.106588243	5.06844653	6.581845742	None	2	Singh A, Reinders MJ, Mahfouz A, Abdelaal T. scTopoGAN: unsupervised manifold alignment of single-cell data. bioRxiv. 2022 Apr 29:2022-04.

While the increasing availability of multiple data modalities is expected to provide a more accurate clustering and characterisation of cells, the development of computational methods that are capable of extracting information embedded across data modalities is still in its infancy. We propose SnapCCESS for clustering cells by integrating data modalities in multimodal singlecell omics data using an unsupervised ensemble deep learning framework. By creating snapshots of embeddings of multimodality using variational autoencoders, SnapCCESS can be coupled with various clustering algorithms for generating consensus clustering of cells. We applied SnapCCESS with several clustering algorithms to various datasets generated from popular multimodal single-cell omics technologies. Our results demonstrate that SnapCCESS is effective and more efficient than conventional ensemble deep learning-based clustering methods and outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal embedding generation methods in integrating data modalities for clustering cells. The improved clustering of cells from SnapCCESS will pave the way for more accurate characterisation of cell identity and types, an essential step for various downstream analyses of multimodal single-cell omics data.

Current multi-omics analysis algorithms failed to systematically dissect the heterogeneity within the datasets when inferring cis-regulatory events. Thus, there is a need for cis-regulatory element inferring algorithms that considers the cellular heterogeneity. Here, we propose scGREAT, a single-cell multi-omics regulatory state analysis Python package with a rapid graph-based correlation measurement L. The graph-based correlation method assigns each cell a local L index, pinpointing specific cell groups of certain regulatory states. Such single-cell resolved regulatory state information enables the heterogeneity analysis equipped in the package. Applying scGREAT to the 10X Multiome PBMC dataset, we demonstrated how it could help subcluster cell types, infer regulation-based pseudo-time trajectory, discover feature modules, and find cluster-specific regulatory gene-peak pairs. Besides, we showed that global L index, which is the average of all local L values, is a better replacement for Pearson’s r in ruling out confounding regulatory relationships that are not of research interests.	scanpy, python-igraph, leidenalg, libpysal, minisom, Homer	Pearson correlation	scGREAT: Graph-based regulatory element analysis tool for single-cell multi-omics data	10.29685005	8.187847554	6.788546042	10.1101/2023.01.27.525916	3	Liu C, Wang L, Liu Z. scGREAT: Graph-based regulatory element analysis tool for single-cell multi-omics data. bioRxiv. 2023:2023-01.

We present FAst MEthylation calling (FAME), the first approach to quantify CpGm values directly from bulk or single-cell WGBS reads without intermediate output files. FAME is very fast but as accurate as standard methods, which first produce BS alignment files before computing CpGm values.

While methods to analyze data from single cell high throughput chromatin conformation capture (scHi-C) experiments are maturing, methods that can jointly analyze multiple single cell modalities with scHi-C data are lacking. Here, we introduce Muscle, a semi-nonnegative joint decomposition of Multiple single cell tensors, to jointly analyze 3D conformation and DNA methylation data at the single cell level. Muscle takes advantage of the inherent tensor structure of the scHi-C data, and integrates this modality with DNA methylation. We developed an alternating least squares algorithm for estimating Muscle parameters and established its optimality properties. Parameters estimated by Muscle directly align with the key components of the downstream analysis of scHi-C data in a cell type specific manner. Evaluations with data-driven experiments and simulations demonstrate the advantages of the joint modeling framework of Muscle over single modality modeling or a baseline multi modality modeling for cell type delineation and elucidating associations between modalities.

At the molecular and cellular level, the concept of biological age has been established and biomarkers of biological age have been identified, notably epigenetic DNA-methylation based clocks. With the emergence of single-cell DNA methylation profiling methods, the possibility to study biological age of individual cells has been proposed, and a first proof-of-concept study, based on limited single cell datasets mostly from early developmental origin, indicated the feasibility and relevance of this approach to better understand organismal changes and cellular ageing heterogeneity. Here we generated a large single-cell DNA methylation and matched transcriptome dataset from mouse peripheral blood samples, spanning a broad range of ages (10-101 weeks of age). We observed that the number of genes expressed increased at older ages, but gene specific changes were small. We next developed a robust single cell DNA methylation age predictor (scEpiAge), which can accurately predict age in a broad range of publicly available datasets, including very sparse data and it also predicts age in single cells. Interestingly, the DNA methylation age distribution is wider than technically expected in 19% of single cells, suggesting that epigenetic age heterogeneity is present in vivo and may relate to functional differences between cells. In addition, we observe differences in epigenetic ageing between the major blood cell types. Our work provides a foundation for better single-cell and sparse data epigenetic age predictors and highlights the significance of cellular heterogeneity during ageing.

However, these effector cells can eliminate infection through modulation of critical cytokines such as IL12 and key players involved in its production. Using sophisticated tool of single cell ATAC sequencing we analyzed the regulatory axis of IL10 and IL12 in time dependent manner for L.major infection in macrophages. We recognized the cellular heterogeneity post infection with the regulators of IL10 and IL12 and observed a reciprocal relationship between them. Our prominent findings also exposed sleepy macrophages and its role in IL10 and IL12 reciprocity. To summarize, role of NFAT5 was vital in identification of sleepy macrophages which is a transient state where transcription factors controlled the epigenetic remodeling and expression of genes involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine production and recruitment of immune cells.

However, the high dimensional, discrete, and sparse nature of the data make the downstream analysis particularly challenging. Most of the existing computational methods for single-cell data analysis are either limited to single modality or lack flexibility and interpretability. In this study, we propose an interpretable deep learning method called multi-omic embedded topic model (moETM) to effectively perform integrative analysis of high-dimensional single-cell multimodal data. moETM integrates multiple omics data via a product-of-experts in the encoder for efficient variational inference and then employs multiple linear decoders to learn the multi-omic signatures of the gene regulatory programs. Through comprehensive experiments on public single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data (i.e., scRNA+scATAC), as well as scRNA and proteomic data (i.e., CITE-seq), moETM demonstrates superior performance compared with six state-of-the-art single-cell data analysis methods on seven publicly available datasets. By applying moETM to the scRNA+scATAC data in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we identified sequence motifs corresponding to the transcription factors that regulate immune gene signatures. Applying moETM analysis to CITE-seq data from the COVID-19 patients revealed not only known immune cell-type-specific signatures but also composite multi-omic biomarkers of critical conditions due to COVID-19, thus providing insights from both biological and clinical perspectives.	scanpy	SMILE, Cobolt, MOFA, scMM, MultiVI.TotalVI, SeuratV4	Single-cell multi-omic topic embedding reveals cell-type-specific and COVID-19 severity-related immune signatures	9.474568835	9.41325306	10.93301358	10.1101/2023.01.31.526312	7	Zhou M, Zhang H, Bai Z, Mann-Krzisnik D, Wang F, Li Y.

Recent progress in multiplexed 3D FISH imaging, single cell Hi-C and genome structure modeling allows a closer analysis of the structural variations of chromosomes between cells to infer the functional implications of structural heterogeneity. Here, we introduce a two-step dimensionality reduction method to classify a population of single cell 3D chromosome structures, either from simulation or imaging experiment, into dominant conformational clusters with distinct chromosome morphologies. We found that almost half of all structures for each chromosome can be described by 5-10 dominant chromosome morphologies, which play a fundamental role in establishing conformational variation of chromosomes. These morphologies are conserved in different cell types, but vary in their relative proportion of structures. Chromosome morphologies are distinguished by the presence or absence of characteristic chromosome territory domains, which expose some chromosomal regions to varying nuclear environments in different morphologies, such as nuclear positions and associations to nuclear speckles, lamina, and nucleoli. These observations point to distinct functional variations for the same chromosomal region in different chromosome morphologies. We validated chromosome conformational clusters and their associated subnuclear locations with data from DNA-MERFISH imaging and single cell sci-HiC data. Our method provides an important approach to assess the variation of chromosome structures between cells and link differences in conformational states with distinct gene functions.	keras	None	Conformational analysis of chromosome structures reveals vital role of chromosome morphology in gene function	3.480631418	5.440841891	5.761262836	10.1101/2023.02.18.528138	3	Zhan Y, Yildirim A, Boninsegna L, Alber F.

Here, we combine single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data to discover cellular niches within eight regions of the human heart. We map cells to micro-anatomic locations and integrate knowledge-based and unsupervised structural annotations. For the first time, we profile the cells of the human cardiac conduction system, revealing their distinctive repertoire of ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors, and cell interactions using a custom CellPhoneDB.org module. We show that the sinoatrial node is compartmentalised, with a core of pacemaker cells, fibroblasts and glial cells supporting paracrine glutamatergic signalling. We introduce a druggable target prediction tool, drug2cell, which leverages single-cell profiles and drug-target interactions, providing unexpected mechanistic insights into the chronotropic effects of drugs, including GLP-1 analogues. In the epicardium, we show enrichment of both IgG+ and IgA+ plasma cells forming immune niches which may contribute to infection defence. We define a ventricular myocardial-stress niche enriched for activated fibroblasts and stressed cardiomyocytes, cell states that are expanded in cardiomyopathies. Overall, we provide new clarity to cardiac electro-anatomy and immunology, and our suite of computational approaches can be deployed to other tissues and organs.	anndata, statsmodels, scipy	None	Spatially resolved multiomics of human cardiac niches	8.224954579	7.735091663	6.47592429	10.1101/2023.01.30.526202	4	Kanemaru K, Cranley J, Muraro D, Miranda AM, Pett JP, Litvinukova M, Kumasaka N, Ho SY, Polanski K, Richardson L, Mach L.

More recently, multi-omic technologies have emerged which can simultaneously measure gene expression and the epigenomic state of the same cell, holding the promise to unlock our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation. However, the sparsity and noisy nature of the data pose fundamental statistical challenges which hinder our ability to extract biological knowledge from these complex data sets. Here we propose SHARE-Topic, a Bayesian generative model of multi-omic single cell data which addresses these challenges from the point of view of topic models. SHARE-Topic identifies common patterns of co-variation between different ‘omic layers, providing interpretable explanations for the complexity of the data. Tested on joint ATAC and expression data, SHARE-Topic was able to provide low dimensional representations that recapitulate known biology, and to define in a principled way associations between genes and distal regulators in individual cells. We illustrate SHARE-Topic in a case study of B-cell lymphoma, studying the usage of alternative promoters in the regulation of the FOXP1 transcription factors.

There is thus a growing need for multi-view learning methods able to jointly analyze these data. We here present Multi-Omics Wasserstein inteGrative anaLysIs (Mowgli), a novel method for the integration of paired multi-omics data with any type and number of omics. Of note, Mowgli combines integrative Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Optimal Transport (OT), enhancing at the same time the clustering performance and interpretability of integrative NMF. We apply Mowgli to multiple paired single-cell multi-omics data profiled with 10X Multiome, CITE-seq and TEA-seq. Our in depth benchmark demonstrates that Mowgli’s performance is competitive with the state-of-the-art in cell clustering and superior to the state-of-the-art once considering biological interpretability.

These two data types provide complementary information for deciphering cell types/states. However, when analyzed individually, scRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data often produce conflicting results regarding cell type/state assignment. In addition, there is a loss of power as the two modalities reflect the same underlying cell types/states. Recently, it has become possible to measure both gene expression and chromatin accessibility from the same nucleus. Such paired data make it possible to directly model the relationships between the two modalities. However, given the availability of the vast amount of single-modality data, it is desirable to integrate the paired and unpaired single-modality data to gain a comprehensive view of the cellular complexity. Here, we benchmarked the performance of seven existing single-cell multi-omic data integration methods. Specifically, we evaluated whether these methods are able to uncover peak-gene associations from single-modality data, and to what extent the multiome data can provide additional guidance for the analysis of the existing single-modality data. Our results indicate that multiome data are helpful for annotating single-modality data, but the number of cells in the multiome data is critical to ensure a good cell type annotation. Additionally, when generating a multiome dataset, the number of cells is more important than sequencing depth for cell type annotation. Lastly, Seurat v4 is the best at integrating scRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and multiome data even in the presence of complex batch effects.

Here, we have utilized single-cell methylome and transcriptome sequencing (scM&T-seq) to quantify both mRNA expression and DNA methylation in oocytes and a developmental series of human embryos at single-cell resolution. We fully characterize embryonic genome activation and maternal transcript degradation and map key epigenetic reprogramming events in developmentally high-quality embryos. By comparing these signatures with early embryos that have undergone spontaneous cleavage-stage arrest, as determined by time-lapse imaging, we identify embryos that fail to appropriately activate their genomes or undergo epigenetic reprogramming. Our results indicate that a failure to successfully accomplish these essential milestones impedes the developmental potential of pre-implantation embryos and is likely to have important implications, similar to aneuploidy, for the success of assisted reproductive cycles.

Most methods developed for inferring transcription factor (TF)–gene interactions either relied on a small dataset or used snapshot data which is not suitable for inferring a process that is inherently temporal. Here, we developed a new computational method that combines neural networks and multi-task learning to predict RNA velocity rather than gene expression values. This allows our method to overcome many of the problems faced by prior methods leading to more accurate and more comprehensive set of identified regulatory interactions. Application of our method to atlas scale single cell data from 6 HuBMAP tissues led to several validated and novel predictions and greatly improved on prior methods proposed for this task.

This model, however, does not explain the neurogenic capability of murine postnatal enteric glial cells. To characterize the full diversity of myenteric glial cells and identify a basis for the glial-to-neuronal transition, which we demonstrate using a two-marker system, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing and single-nucleus ATAC sequencing to generate a multiomic atlas of Plp1-expressing glial cells from the small intestine of adolescent mice. We identify nine transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of enteric glial cells, including cells expressing both canonical neural stem cell genes and enteric neuronal transcriptional factors. We refer to these Plp1- positive cells with neural stem cell features as glial neuroblasts. Surprisingly, most glial cells maintain open chromatin at neuronal-associated loci, suggesting enteric glia are primed for neuronal transition. Comparison with the developing embryonic enteric nervous system shows postnatal glial cells maintain a transcriptional program closely matching embryonic neuronal progenitors. Transcription factor motif enrichment analysis and regulon analysis implicate AP-1 transcription factors in maintaining the glial neuroblast gene program. Three-dimensional cultures of postnatal enteric nervous system cells, which are enriched for glial neuroblasts and provide a niche for neuronal development, recapitulate the transcriptional changes seen during embryonic enteric neurogenesis. snATAC analysis shows chromatin closing consistent with terminal differentiation as glial cells become neurons in three-dimensional culture. In conclusion, postnatal myenteric glial cells include a neuroblast population and maintain a chromatin structure primed for neuronal fate acquisition.

However, most are based on Euclidean space, which would distort the complex hierarchical structure of cell differentiation. Recently, methods acting on hyperbolic space have been proposed to visualize hierarchical structures in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data and have been proven to be superior to methods acting on Euclidean space. However, these methods have fundamental limitations and are not optimized for the highly sparse single-cell count data. To address these limitations, we propose scDHMap, a model-based deep learning approach to visualize the complex hierarchical structures of scRNA-seq data in low-dimensional hyperbolic space. The evaluations on extensive simulation and real experiments show that scDHMap outperforms existing dimensionality-reduction methods in various common analytical tasks as needed for scRNA-seq data, including revealing trajectory branches, batch correction, and denoising the count matrix with high dropout rates. In addition, we extend scDHMap to visualize single-cell ATAC-seq data.	pytorch, scanpy, sklearn, numpy, h5py	PoincareMap, scPhere, Scvis, PaCMap, PHATE, BC-t-SNE 	Complex hierarchical structures in single-cell genomics data unveiled by deep hyperbolic manifold learning	11.4820039005457	7.13753450932949	9.07109360729444	None	1.0	Tian T, Zhong C, Lin X, Wei Z, Hakonarson H.

The platform leverages the core of the sciATAC workflow where multiple indexed tagmentation reactions are performed, followed by pooling and distribution to a second set of reaction wells for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based indexing. In this work, we instead leverage a chip containing 5184 nanowells at the PCR stage of indexing, enabling a 52-fold improvement in scale and reduction in per-cell preparation costs. We detail three variants that balance cell throughput and depth of coverage, and apply these methods to banked mouse brain tissue, producing maps of cell types as well as neuronal subtypes that include integration with existing single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (scATAC) and scRNA-seq data sets. Our optimized workflow achieves a high fraction of reads that fall within called peaks (>80%) and low cell doublet rates. The high cell coverage technique produces high unique reads per cell, while retaining high enrichment for open chromatin regions, enabling the assessment of >70,000 unique accessible loci on average for each cell profiled. When compared to current methods in the field, our technique provides similar or superior per-cell information with very low levels of cell-to-cell cross talk, and achieves this at a cost point much lower than existing assays.	numpy, pandas	None	Atlas-scale single-cell chromatin accessibility using nanowell-based combinatorial indexing	5.29197822324744	3.88762359577343	4.03508762036517	None	0.0	O'Connell BL, Nichols RV, Pokholok D, Thomas J, Acharya SN, Nishida A, Thornton CA, Fields AJ, Steemers FJ, Adey AC.

This expression switch at differentiation suggests that MAPT expression is controlled by transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements specific to these differentiated cell types, including neurons. Using three-dimensional chromatin conformation capture (Capture-C), single-nucleus multiomics (RNA-seq and ATAC-seq), and chromatin marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and chromatin accessibility (DNase hypersensitivity and ATAC-seq)), we nominated 94 unique regions as candidate cis-regulatory elements for MAPT in human NPCs, NPCs differentiated to neurons, and pure inhibitory or excitatory neuron cultures. We then functionally assessed nominated regions using luciferase assays to test sufficiency for regulatory activity as well as with CRISPR inhibition experiments to assess the effect of nominated regions on MAPT expression. We identified both proximal and distal regulatory elements for MAPT and confirmed the funciton for several regions, including three regions centromeric to MAPT beyond the well-described H1/H2 haplotype inversion breakpoint.

Furthermore, the multi-omic profiling technology could jointly measure two or more traits in a single cell simultaneously. In order to process the various data accumulated rapidly, computational methods for multimodal data integration are needed. Previously, we developed inClust, a flexible all-in deep generative framework for transcriptome data. Here, we extend the applicability of inClust into the realm of multimodal data by adding two mask modules: an input-mask module in front of the encoder and an output-mask module behind the decoder. We call this augmented model inClust+, and apply it to various multimodal data. InClust+ was first used to integrate scRNA and MERFISH data from similar cell populations and to impute MERFISH data based on scRNA data. Then, inClust+ is shown to have the capability to integrate a multimodal data contain scRNA and scATAC or two multimodal CITE datasets with batch effect. Finally, inClust+ is used to integrate a monomodal scRNA dataset and two multimodal CITE datasets, and generate the missing modality of surface protein in monomodal scRNA data. In the above examples, the performance of inClust+ is better than or comparable to the most recent tools to the corresponding task, which prove inClust+ is a suitable framework for handling multimodal data. Meanwhile, the successful implementation of mask in inClust+ means that it can be applied to other deep learning methods with similar encoder-decoder architecture to broaden the application scope of these models.

Despite its potential, the integrated analysis and prediction of cellular states based on this complex multi-omics data pose significant challenges due to data sparsity, high noise, and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we developed scMinerva, an unsupervised framework for single-cell multi-omics integrated analysis. The learned embeddings from the multi-omics data enable accurate integrated classification of cell types and stages. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous graph from multiple omics and propose a novel biased random walk algorithm omics2vec, which can learn the heterogeneous biological graph in a way that balances both local and global network structures. scMinerva successfully outperforms existing unsupervised methods on various simulated and real-world datasets when fine-tuned by very few labels. Additionally, scMinerva demonstrates strong label efficiency, is robust to fluctuation in data quality, allows one omics to compensate for weakness in others and could effectively classify cells with different annotation granularities. Furthermore, we showcase scMinerva’s ability to accurately provide prospective biomarkers and predict cell differentiation trends for COVID-19-infected cells, through the joint analysis of multi-omics data.	pytorch, numpy, pandas	MOFA+, Conos, Seurat	scMinerva: an Unsupervised Graph Learning Framework with Label-efficient Fine-tuning for Single-cell Multi-omics Integrated Analysis	8.8605653451484	8.857546675106	9.4605653451484	10.1101/2022.05.28.493838	6.0	Yu T, Zong Y, Wang Y, Wang X, Li Y. scMinerva: a GCN-featured Interpretable Framework for Single-cell Multi-omics Integration with Random Walk on Heterogeneous Graph. bioRxiv. 2022 May 29:2022-05.

Existing tools cannot effectively infer the active biological networks in diverse cell types and the response of these networks to external stimuli. Here we present DeepMAPS for biological network inference from scMulti-omics. It models scMulti-omics in a heterogeneous graph and learns relations among cells and genes within both local and global contexts in a robust manner using a multi-head graph transformer. Benchmarking results indicate DeepMAPS performs better than existing tools in cell clustering and biological network construction. It also showcases competitive capability in deriving cell-type-specific biological networks in lung tumor leukocyte CITE-seq data and matched diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. In addition, we deploy a DeepMAPS webserver equipped with multiple functionalities and visualizations to improve the usability and reproducibility of scMulti-omics data analysis.	pytorch	Seurat, MOFA+, Harmony, TotalVI, GLUE	Single-cell biological network inference using a heterogeneous graph transformer	38.4220562436275	25.8306165684835	13.6496971132654	None	8.0	Ma A, Wang X, Li J, Wang C, Xiao T, Liu Y, Cheng H, Wang J, Li Y, Chang Y, Li J.

However, the analysis of multimodal single-cell omics data is challenging due to the lack of methods that can integrate across multiple data modalities generated from such technologies. Here, we present Matilda, a multi-task learning method for integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell omics data. By leveraging the interrelationship among tasks, Matilda learns to perform data simulation, dimension reduction, cell type classification, and feature selection in a single unified framework. We compare Matilda with other state-of-the-art methods on datasets generated from some of the most popular multimodal single-cell omics technologies. Our results demonstrate the utility of Matilda for addressing multiple key tasks on integrative multimodal single-cell omics data analysis.

However, contemporary methods disregard the omics individuality, and the high noise, sparsity, and heterogeneity of single-cell data also impact the fusion effect. Furthermore, available single-cell clustering methods only focus on the cell type clustering, which can not mine the alternative clustering to comprehensively analyze cells. Results : We propose a single-cell data fusion based multiple clustering (scMCs) approach that can jointly model single-cell transcriptomics and epigenetic data, and explore multiple different clusterings. scMCs first mines the omics-specific and cross-omics consistent representations, then fuses them into a co-embedding representation, which can dissect cellular heterogeneity and impute data. To discover the potential alternative clustering embedded in multi-omics, scMCs projects the co-embedding representation into different salient subspaces. Meanwhile, it reduces the redundancy between subspaces to enhance the diversity of alternative clusterings and optimizes the cluster centers in each subspace to boost the quality of corresponding clustering. Unlike single clustering, these alternative clusterings provide additional perspectives for understanding complex genetic information such as cell types and states. Experimental results show that scMCs can effectively identify subcellular types, impute dropout events, and uncover diverse cell characteristics by giving different but meaningful clusterings.	pytorch, scanpy, scipy, sklearn	JSNMF, UnionCom, scMVAE, DCCA	scMCs: a framework for single cell multi-omics data integration and multiple clusterings	5.50922447210179	6.67896596280238	8.61844894420357	None	4.0	Ren L, Wang J, Li Z, Li Q, Yu G. scMCs: a framework for single cell multi-omics data integration and multiple clusterings.
